</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is an attraction about
carpets and curtains, chairs and
sofas, and the mantelpiece which
is hard to explain, and harder to
resist. I feel it in all its insidious power
this morning as I am bidding them farewell
for a considerable time; I would not
have believed that a venerable Axminster
and an arm-chair on three casters could
absorb and hold so much affection; verily
I think, standing in the door, it was these
things that made Lot’s wife turn her unlucky
head. Dear me, how they enter in,
how they grow to be part of us, these objects
of ordinary use and comfort that we
place within the four walls of the little
shelters we build for ourselves on the
fickle round o’ the world! I have gone
back, I have sat down, I will not be deprived
of them; they are necessary to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
courage with which every one must face life.
I will consider nothing without a cushion,
on the hither side of the window, braced by
dear familiar bookshelves, and the fender.
And Tiglath-Pileser has come, and has
quoted certain documents, and has used
gentle propulsive force, and behold, because
I am a person whose contumacy cannot
endure, the door is shut, and I am on
the outside disconsolate.</p>

<p>I would not have more sympathy than
I can afterwards sustain; I am only banished
to the garden. But the banishment
is so definite, so permanent! Its terms
are plain to my unwilling glance, a long
cane deck chair anchored under a tree.
Overhead the sky, on the four sides the
sky, without a pattern, full of wind and
nothing. Abroad the landscape, consisting
entirely of large mountains; about, the
garden. I never regarded a garden with
more disfavour. Here I am to remain—but
to <i>remain</i>! The word expands, you
will find, as you look into it. Man, and
especially woman, is a restless being, made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
to live in houses roaming from room to
room, and always staying for the shortest
time moreover, if you notice, in the one
which is called the garden. The subtle and
gratifying law of arrangement that makes
the drawing-room the only proper place for
afternoon tea operates all through. The
convenience of one apartment, the quiet of
another, the decoration of another regularly
appeal in turn, and there is always one’s
beloved bed, for retirement when the world
is too much with one. All this I am compelled
to resign for a single fixed fact and
condition, a cane chair set in the great
monotony of out-of-doors. My eye, which
is a captious organ, is to find its entertainment
all day long in bushes—and grass.
All day long. Except for meals it is absolutely
laid down that I am not to “come
in.” They have not locked the doors, that
might have been negotiated, they have gone
and put me on my honour. From morning
until night I am to sit for several
months and breathe, with the grass and the
bushes, the beautiful pure fresh air. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
don’t know why they have not asked me
to take root and be done with it. In vain
I have represented that microbes will agree
with them no better than with me; it seems
the common or house microbe is one of the
things that I particularly mustn’t have.
Some people are compelled to deny themselves
oysters, others strawberries or artichokes;
my fate is not harder than another’s.
Yet it tastes of bitterness to sit out here in an
April wind twenty paces from a door behind
which they are enjoying, in customary warmth
and comfort, all the microbes there are.</p>

<p>I have consented to this. I have been
wrought upon certainly, but I have consented.
For all that, it is not so simple as
it looks. It is my occupation to write out
with care and patience the trifles the world
shows me, revolving as it does upon its axis
before every intelligent eye; and I cannot
be divorced from all that is upholstered and
from my dear occupation by the same decree.
And how, I ask you, how observe
life from a cane chair under a tree in a garden!
There is the beautiful pure fresh air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
certainly, and there are the things coming
up. But what, tell me, can you extract
from air beside water; and though a purely
vegetable romance would be a novelty,
could I get it published? Tiglath-Pileser
has contributed to my difficulty a book of
reference, a volume upon the coleoptera of
the neighbourhood, and I am to take care
of it. I am taking the greatest care of it,
but I do not like to hand it back to him
with the sentiments I feel in case one fine
day I should be reduced to coleoptera and
thankful to get them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I have no choice, I cannot
go forth in the world’s ways and see what
people are doing there, I must just sit under
my tree and think and consider upon the
current facts of a garden, the bursting buds
I suppose and the following flowers, the
people who happen that way and the ideas
the wind brings; the changes of the seasons—there’s
fashion after all in that—the
behaviour of the ants and earwigs; oh, I
am encouraged, in the end it will be a novel
of manners!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>Besides, there ought to be certain virtues,
if one could find them, in <i>plein air</i>, for scribbling
as well as for painting. One’s head
always feels particularly empty in a garden,
but that is no reason why one should not
see what is going on there, and if one’s impressions
are a trifle incoherent—the wind
does blow the leaves about—they will be
on that account all the more impressionistic.</p>

<p>Yet it is <i>not</i> so simple as it looks. In
such a project everything depends, it will be
admitted, upon the garden; it must be a
tolerably familiar, at least a conceivable spot.
The garden of Paradise, for instance, who
would choose it as a <i>point de repaire</i> from
which to observe the breed of Adam at the
beginning of the twentieth century? One
would be interrupted everywhere by the
necessity of describing the flora and fauna;
it would be like writing a botany book with
interpolations which would necessarily seem
profane; and the whole thing would be
rejected in the end because it was not a
scientific treatise upon the origin of apples.
Certainly, if one might select one’s plot, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
first consideration should be the geographical,
and I am depressed to think that my
garden is only less remote than Eve’s. It
is not an English garden—ah, the thought!—nor
a French one where they count the
seeds and the windfalls, nor an Italian one
sunning down past its statues to the blue
Adriatic, nor even a garden in the neighbourhood
of Poughkeepsie where they grow
pumpkins. Elizabeth in her German garden
was three thousand miles nearer to
everybody than my cane chair is at this
moment. How can I possibly expect
people to come three thousand miles just
to sit and talk under my pencil-cedar? So
“long” an invitation requires such confidence,
such assurance!</p>

<p>Who indeed should care to hear about
every day as it goes on under a conifer in
a garden, when that garden—let me keep
it back no longer—is a mere patch on a
mountain top of the Himalayas? Not even
India down below there, grilling in the sun
which is not quite warm enough here—that
would be easy with snakes and palm-trees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
and mangoes and chutneys all growing
round, ready and familiar; but Simla, what
is Simla? An artificial little community
which has climbed eight thousand feet out
of the world to be cool. Who ever leaves
Charing Cross for Simla? Who among the
world’s multitudes ever casts an eye across
the Rajputana deserts to Simla? Does
Thomas Cook know where Simla is? No;
Simla is a geographical expression, to be
verified upon the map and never to be
thought of again, and a garden in Simla is
a vague and formless fancy, a possibility, no
more.</p>

<p>Yet people have to live there, I have to
live there; and certainly for the next few
months I have to make the best of it from
the outside. If you ask yourself what you
really think of a garden you will find that
you consider it a charming place to go out
into. So much I gladly admit if you add
the retreat and background of the house.
The house is such an individual; such a
friend! Even in Simla the house offers
corners where may lurk the imagination,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
nails on which to hang a rag of fancy; but
in this windy patch under the sky surrounded
by Himalayas, one Himalaya behind another
indefinitely, who could find two ideas to rub
together?</p>

<p>Also my cane chair is becoming most
pitiably weary; it aches in every limb. The
sun was poor and pale enough; now it has
gone altogether, a greyness has blown out
of Thibet, my fingers are almost too numb
to say how cold it is. The air is full of an
apprehension of rain—if it rains do you
suppose I am to come in? Indeed no, I
am to have an umbrella. Uncomforted,
uncomfortable fate! I wish it would rain;
I could then pity myself so profoundly, so
abjectly, I would lie heroic, still and stoic;
and at the appointed time I would take my
soaking, patient person into the house with
a trail of drops, pursued by Thisbe with
hot-water bottles, which I would reject, to
her greater compassion and more contrition.
And in the morning it would be a queer
thing if I couldn’t produce rheumatism
somewhere. Short of rain, however, it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
be impossible to give a correct and adequate
impression of the bald inhospitality of out-of-doors.
They will think I want to be
pitied and admired, and Thisbe will say,
“But didn’t you really enjoy it—just a
little?”</p>

<p>Walls are necessary to human happiness—that
I can asseverate. Tiglath-Pileser, in
bringing me to this miserable point, argued
that I should experience the joys of primitive
man when he took all nature for his
living-room; subtle, long-lost sensations
would arise in me, he said, of such a persuasive
character that in the end I should
have to combat the temptation to take entirely
to the woods. I expect nothing of
the kind. My original nomad is too far
away, I cannot sympathize with him in his
embryotic preferences across so many wisest
centuries. Moreover, if the poor barbarian
had an intelligent idea it was to get under
shelter, and that is the only one, doubtless,
for which we have to thank him.</p>

<p>The windows are blank; they think it
kindest, I suppose, not to appear to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
entertainment in my situation. It is certainly
wisest; if Thisbe showed but the tip
of her pretty nose I should throw it up.
The windows are blank, the door is shut,
but hold—there is smoke coming out of
the drawing-room chimney! Thisbe has
lighted unto herself a fire and is now drawn
up around it awaiting the tea-things. The
house as an ordinary substantive is hard
enough to resist, but the-house-with-a-fire!
No, I cannot. Besides it is already half-past
four and I was to come in at five to tea.
I will obey the spirit and scorn the letter of
the law—I will go in now.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter II</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A ROAD winds round the hill
above our heads; another winds
round the hill below our feet;
between is a shelf jutting out.</p>

<p>The principal object on the shelf is the
house, but it also supports the pencil-cedar,
and the garden sits on it, and at the back
the servants’ quarters and stables just don’t
slip off; so that when Tiglath-Pileser walks
about it with his hands in his pockets it
looks a little crowded. The land between
the upper road and the shelf, and the land
between the shelf and the lower road is
equally ours, but it is placed at such an
abrupt and uncompromising angle that we
do not know any way of taking possession
of it. By surface measurement we are
doubtless large proprietors, but as the crow
flies we are distinctly over-taxed. This
slanting hill-side is called the khud; there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
is no real property in a khud. One always
thinks of town lots as flat and running from
the front street to the back, with suitable
exposure for the washing. It just depends.
This one stands on end, you could easily
send a stone rolling from the front street
into the back, if you knew which was
which; and there would be rather too much
exposure for the washing. If you like you
can lean up against the khud, but that is the
only way of asserting your title-deed, and
few people consider it worth doing. I may
say that as soon as you tilt your property
out of the horizontal you lose control over
it. Things come up on it precisely as they
like, in tufts, in suckers and in every vulgar
manner, secure and defiant it rises above
your head. Tiglath-Pileser and I have
sought diligently, with ladders, for some way
of bringing our khud into subjection, but in
vain. As he says we might paper it, but as I
say there are some things which persons who
derive their income from current literature
simply can <i>not</i> afford. So we are content
perforce to look at it and “call it ours,” as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
children are sometimes allowed by their
elders to do. The khud is God’s property
but we call it ours. Trees grow on it and
it makes a more agreeable background, after
all, than other people’s kitchens.</p>

<p>Beyond the shelf the hill-side slopes clear
from the upper road to the lower, a stretch
of indefinite jungle which flourishes, no man
aiding or forbidding. We have sometimes
looked at it vaguely and thought of potatoes,
but have always decided that it was useful
enough and much less troublesome as part
of the landscape. The other day the law
threatened us if Tiglath-Pileser did not
forthwith declare his boundaries in that
direction, and he has since been going about
with a measuring-chain and a great pretence
of accuracy; but it is my private belief that
neither he nor his neighbour will be equal to
the demand. They had better agree quickly
and hatch a friendly deposition together, and
so escape whatever penalty the law awards
for not knowing where your premises leave
off. Meanwhile the wild cherry and the
unkempt rhododendron grow in one accord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
indifferent to these foolish claims. Such
is ownership in a khud.</p>

<p>Our domain therefore is spread out about
as much as it would hang from a clothes-line,
but the only part we really inhabit is
the shelf. All this by way of informing
you honestly that the garden in which you
are invited to lighten so many long hours
for me is no great place. Here and now
I abjure invention and idealization; you
shall have just what happens, just what
there is, and it won’t be much. Pot-luck—you
can’t expect more from a garden on
a shelf. I must admit that before I was
turned out to grow in it myself I thought it
well enough, but now I regard it critically,
like the other plants. We might do better,
all of us, under more favourable conditions.
We complain unanimously, for one thing,
of the lack of room. Cramped we are to
such an extent that I often feel thankful
for the paling that runs along the edge and
keeps us all in. I suppose nobody ever
believed that his lot gave him proper scope
for his activities in this world, but I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
testify that the wisteria which twines over the
paling is pushing a middle-aged hibiscus bush
down the khud, while I, sitting here, elbow
them both, and a honeysuckle, climbing up
from below has to cling with both hands to
hold on. If I invite a friend to take a walk
in my garden I must go in front declaiming
and he must come behind assenting; we
cannot waste space on mere paths, and none
of them are wide enough for two people to
walk abreast, except the main one to the
door, which had to be on account of the
rickshaws. As it is, pansies, daisies and
other small objects constantly slip over the
edge and hang there precariously attached
by the slenderest root of family affection
for days. We are all convinced in this
garden, that for expansion one would not
choose a shelf, and that applies in quite a
ridiculous way to Simla itself, though perhaps
it is hardly worth while, out here in
the sun, to write an essay to explain exactly
how.</p>

<p>I would not show myself of a churlish
mind; the day is certainly fine, as fine a day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
as you could be compelled to sit out in. A
week has passed since I lent myself to be a
spectacle of domestic tyranny and modern
science, and I hasten to announce that although
I want to eat more and to go to bed
earlier I am not at all better. I have let the
week go by without taking any notice of it in
this journal under the impression that it was
not worth the pains, as they say in France.
It was doubtless a wonderful week in nature,
but which of the fifty-two is not? and being
certain that my fountain pen would be anything
but a source of amiability, I left it in
the house. Moreover, there is something
not quite proper, one finds, in confiding an
experience of personal discomfort, undergone
with the object of improving one’s health,
to the printed page; it is akin to lending
one’s maladies to an advertiser of patent
medicines, and tends to give light literature
too much the character of a human document.
Also, to look back upon, the late week holds
little but magnificent resolution and the sensation
of cold feet. All that need be said
about it is that I have at last arrived at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
end of it, full of fortitude and resignation.
I am not at all better, but I am resigned and
prepared to go on, if it is required of me,
and it seems likely to be. In fact it appears
to have occurred to nobody but myself that
there was anything experimental about this
period. The whole summer is to be the experiment,
I am told, as often as if they were
addressing the meanest intelligence, which is
not the case.</p>

<p>My sensibilities no doubt are becoming
slightly blunted. A whole week without a
roof over one’s head except at night would
naturally have that tendency. I find that
I am no longer a prey to the desire to go
in and look at something in the last number
of <i>The Studio</i>, and the more subtly tormented
of modern novelties fails to hold my attention
for more than half-an-hour at a time.
The spirit in my feet that would carry me
indoors has still to be bound down, but it
has grown vague and purposeless and might
lead me anywhere, even to the kitchen to
see if the cook is keeping his saucepans
clean, the most detestable responsibility of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
my life. Now that I am a close prisoner
outside the house, by the way, it shall be
delegated to Thisbe. That is no more than
right.</p>

<p>It was not worse than I expected, and it
was a little less bad, let me confess, than I
described it to my family. I can now sympathize
with the youthful knight of the
middle ages at the end of his first night’s
ghostly vigil in the sanctuary,—if the rest
are no worse than this they can be got
through with. I am certainly on better
terms with nature, as he was on better terms
with the skeleton in the vault, apprehending
with him in that neither of them was really
calculated to do us any harm. He no doubt
lost his superstitions as I am losing my finer
feelings; whether one is sufficiently compensated
for them by a vulgar appetite and
a tendency to drowsiness immediately after
dinner is a question I should like to discuss
with him.</p>

<p>For one thing I am beginning to make
acquaintance with the Days and to know
them apart, not merely as sunny days, dull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
days, windy days and wet days, as they are
commonly unobserved and divided, but in
the full and abundant personality which
every one of the three hundred and sixty-five
offers to the world that rolls under it.
To me also, a very short time ago, the day
was a convenient arrangement for making
things visible outside the house, accompanied
by agreeable or disagreeable temperatures; a
mere condition monotonously recurrent and
quite subordinated to engagements. To live
out here enveloped by it, dependent on it,
in a morning-to-night intimacy with it, is to
know better. The Day is a great elemental
creature left in charge of the world for as
long, every twenty-four hours, as she can see
it. No one day is the same as another;
those of the same season have only a family
likeness. They express character and temperament,
like people, and if you elect to live
with them, to throw yourself, as it were, upon
their better nature with no other protection
than an umbrella, it just makes all the difference.
Some were tender and sweet-tempered,
I remember, some were thoughtful, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
touch of gloom, one was artist with a firm
hand and a splendid palette. And among
all the seven I did not dislike a single Day,
which is remarkable when one thinks of the
abuse one is so apt to let fall, from the inside
of a window, about what our common little
brains call “the weather.” There is no
weather, it is a poor and pointless term,
there is only the mood of a day, and however
badly it may serve our paltry ends it is
bound at least to be interesting. When one
reflects upon how little this great thing is
regarded and how constantly from behind
glass, by miserable men, one is touched with
pity for the ingratitude of the race, and
astonishment at the amount of personal
superiority to be acquired in a week. Day
unto day uttereth speech, swinging a lantern;
it is the business of night to wait. Day after
day, too spiritual to be pagan, too sensuous
to be divine, speeds out of time into the
eternity where planets are served in turn.
Behold, in spite of all their science, I show
you a mystery, high and strange whether the
sun is in his tabernacle or the clouds are on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the hills. But it is there always, you can see
it for yourself. Go out into the garden, not
for a stroll, but for a day.</p>

<p>The week has brought me—and how can
I be too grateful—a new and personal feeling
about this exquisite thing that passes.
Waking in the blackness of the very small
hours I find a delicate gladness in the
thought of the far sure wing of the day.
Already while we lie in the dark it brushes
the curve of the world in that far East which
is so much farther, already on a thousand
slopes and rice fields the grey dawn is beginning,
beginning; and sleeping huts and
silent palaces stand emergent, marvellously
pathetic to the imagination. Even while I
think, it is crisping the sullen waves of the
Yellow Sea; presently some outlying reef of
palms will find its dim picture drawn, and then
we too, high in the middle of Hindostan, will
swing under this vast and solemn operation.
With that precision which reigns in heaven
our turn will also come, and in my garden
and over the hills will walk another day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter III</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is a right side and a
wrong side to the mountain of
Simla, for it was a mountain eight
thousand feet high and equally
important long before it became the summer
headquarters of the Government of India,
and a possible pin-point on the map. These
mountains run across the tip of India, you
will remember, due east and west, so that if
you live on one of them you are very apt to
live due north or south. On the south side
you look down, on a clear day, quite to the
plains, if that is any advantage; you see the
Punjab lying there as flat as the palm of
your hand and streaked with rivers, and the
same sun that burns all India bakes down
upon you. On the north side you have
turned your back on Hindostan and sit upon
the borders of Thibet, a world of mountains
bars your horizon, a hermit Mahatma might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
abide with you in his ashes and have his
meditations disturbed by no thought of
missionaries or income tax. Your prospect
is all blue and purple with a wonderful edge
sometimes of white; cool winds blow out of
it and fan your roses on the hottest day.
Out there is no-man’s-land, where the coolies
come from, or perhaps the country of a little
king who wears his crown embroidered on
his turban, and in India who recks of little
kings? Out there are no Secretariats, no
Army Headquarters, no precedence, probably
very little pay, but the vast blue freedom
of it! And all expanded, all extended
just at your front door. * * * * *</p>

<p>The asterisks stand for the time I have
spent in looking at it. Freely translated
they should express an apology. I find it
one of the pernicious tendencies of living on
this shelf that my eyes constantly wander
out there taking my mind with them, which
at once becomes no more than a vacant
mirror of blue abysses. I look, I know,
immensely serious and thoughtful, and
Thisbe, believing me on the tip of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
high imagination goes round the other way,
whereas I am the merest reflecting puddle
with exactly a puddle’s enjoyment of the
scene. There is neither virtue nor profit
in this, but if I apologized every time I did
it these chapters would be impassable with
asterisks. Thisbe’s method is much more
reasonable; she takes her view immediately
after she takes her breakfast. Coming out
upon the verandah she looks at it intelligently,
pronounces it perfectly lovely or
rather hazy, returns to her employments,
and there is an end to the matter. One
cannot always, in Thisbe’s opinion, be referring
to views. I wish I could adopt this
calm and governed attitude. I should get
on faster in almost every way. It is my
ignominious alternative to turn my back
upon the prospect and look up the khud.</p>

<p>Into my field of vision comes Atma, doing
something to a banksia rose-bush that
climbs over a little arbour erected across a
path apparently for the convenience of the
banksia rose-bush. Atma would tell you,
protector of the poor, that he is the gardener<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
of this place; as a matter of feet his relation
to it is that of tutelary deity and real proprietor.
I have talked in as large a way as
if it belonged to Tiglath-Pileser because he
pays for the repairs, but I should have had
the politeness at least to mention Atma,
whose claims are so much better. So far as
we are concerned Atma is prehistoric; he
was here when we came and when we have
completed the tale of <i>one</i> years of exile and
gone away he will also be here. His hut is
at the very end of the shelf and I have never
been in it, but if you asked him how long
he has lived there he would say, “Always.”
It must make very little difference to Atma
what temporary lords come and give orders
in the house with the magnificent tin roof
where they have table-cloths; some, of
course, are more troublesome than others,
but none of them stay. He and his bulbs
and perennials are the permanent undisputed
facts; it is unimaginable that any of them
should be turned out.</p>

<p>I am more reconciled to my fate when
Atma is in the garden, he is something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
human to look at and to consider, and he
moves with such calm wisdom among the
plants. He has a short black curling beard
that grows almost up to his high cheek-bones,
and soft round brown eyes full of
guileless cunning, and a wide and pleasant
smile. He is just a gentle hill-man and by
religion a gardener, but with his turban
twisted low and flat over his ears he might
be any of the Old Testament characters one
remembers in the pictured Bible stories of
one’s childhood. Something primitive and
natural about him binds him closely to Adam
in my mind. It was with this simplicity
and patience, I am sure, that the original
cultivator tied up his banksias and saved his
portulaca and mignonette after the fall, when
he had something to do beside come to his
meals. I am not the only person; everybody
to whom it is pointed out notices at
once how remarkably Atma takes after the
father of us all. I have often wished to call
him Adam because of his so peculiarly deserving
it; but Tiglath-Pileser says that
profane persons, knowing that he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
have received the name at his baptism, might
laugh and thus hurt his feelings. So he is
Atma still. It is near enough.</p>

<p>He is also patriarchal in his ideas. This
morning he came to us upon the business
of Sropo. Sropo, he said, wished for six
days’ leave in order to marry himself.
“But,” said I, “this is not at all proper.
Sropo went away last year to marry himself.
How shall Sropo have two wives?”</p>

<p>“Nā,” replied Atma, with his kindly
smile, “that was Masuddi. Masuddi has
now a wife and a son has been,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and his
wages are so much the less. Also without
doubt this Sropo could not have two wives.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said Tiglath-Pileser,
virtuously.</p>

<p>“Sropo is of my village,” Atma explained,
genially, “and we folk are all poor men.
More than one wife cannot be taken. But
if we were rich like the Presence,” he went
on, gravely, “we would have five or six.”</p>

<p>Tiglath-Pileser shook his head. “You
would be sorry,” said he. “It would be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
mistake,” but only I saw the ambiguity in his
eye.</p>

<p>“It is not your Honour’s custom,” returned
Atma, simply. “Sropo, then, will go?”</p>

<p>“Call Masuddi,” said Tiglath-Pileser.
“It is a serious matter, this of wives.”</p>

<p>Round the corner of the verandah came
Masuddi, shy and broadly smiling, with an
end of his cotton shirt in the corner of his
mouth and pulling at it, as other kinds of
children pull at their pinafores.</p>

<p>“Masuddi,” said Tiglath-Pileser, “last
year you made a marriage in your house,
and now you have a son. Er—which
young woman did you marry?”</p>

<p>Masuddi’s smile broadened; he cast down
his eyes and scrabbled the gravel about with
his foot. “Tuktoo,” he said shamefacedly.</p>

<p>“Well, there is no harm in that. What
is the name of your son?”</p>

<p>Masuddi looked up intelligently. “How
should he have a name?” he asked. “He has
not yet four months. He came with the snow.
When he has a year, then he will get a name.
My padre-folk—<i>Brahmun</i>—will give it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“But you will say what it is to be,” I
put in.</p>

<p>“Nā,” said Masuddi, “the padre-folk will
say—to their liking.”</p>

<p>“Masuddi,” said Tiglath-Pileser, “speak
straight words—do you beat your wife?”</p>

<p>“Master,” replied Masuddi, “how shall
I utter false talk? When she will not hear
orders I beat her.”</p>

<p>“Masuddi,” said I, “straight words—do
you beat her with a stick?” Laughter
rose up in him, and again he chewed the
end of his garment. “According as my
anger is,” he said, half turning away to hide
his face, “so I beat her.”</p>

<p>“Then she obeys?”</p>

<p>“Then fear is and she listens. Thus it
is,” said Masuddi, his face clearing to an
idea, “as we servant-folk are before your
Honours, so they-folk are before us.”</p>

<p>“You may go, worthy Masuddi,” pronounced
Tiglath-Pileser, “and Atma may
say to Sropo, who is listening behind the
water-barrel, that I have heard the words
of Masuddi and they are just and reasonable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and he may go also and marry himself,
but it must be done in six days, and it must
not occur again.”</p>

<p>Masuddi and Sropo are two of the four
who pull my rickshaw. When I am not
taking carriage exercise they will do almost
anything else, except sew or cook, but I
have discovered that the thing they really
love to be set at is to paint. In the spring
the paling required a fresh brown coat, and
in a moment of inspired economy I decided
that Masuddi and his men should be entrusted
with it. Never was task more willingly
undertaken. With absorption they
mixed the pigment and thewi-oil, squeezing
it with their hands; with joy they laid
it on, competing among themselves, like
Tom Sawyer’s schoolfellows. “Lo, it is
beautiful!” Masuddi would exclaim after
each brushful, drawing back to look at it.
I think they were sorry when it was done.</p>

<p>Atma is of these people, and the two
grooms, and Dumboo, the upper housemaid,
a strapping treasure six feet in his
stockings. I would like it better if all our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
servants were, but it is impossible to conceive
Sropo doing up muslin frills—at
least it is impossible to conceive the frills—and
I could not ask people to eat entrées
sent up by any friend of Masuddi’s. I admit
they do not altogether adapt themselves,
or even wash themselves. I have before
now locked Masuddi and the others up
with a tub and a bar of kitchen soap and
instructions of the most general nature, demanding,
on their release, to <i>see the soap</i>.
It was the only reliable evidence. Besides
if I had not required to see my soap, worn
by honest service, they would have sold it
and bought sweetmeats and gone none the
cleaner. They have many such little ways,
which few people I know consider as engaging
as I do. But what I like best is
their lightheartedness and their touch of
fancy. Sropo will go to his nuptials with
a rose behind his ear—where in my barbarous
West does a young man choose to
approach the altar thus? and when Masuddi
courted Tuktoo upon the mountain paths
in the twilight I think a shy idyll went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
barefoot between them; though he, the
male creature, would make shame of it now,
preferring to speak of sticks and of obedience.
They are the young of the world,
these hill sons and daughters, and they still
remember how the earth they are made of
stirs in the spring. It is late evening in
my garden now—there has seemed, somehow,
no good reason to go in, though one
new leaf in the borders has long been just
like another—and far down the khud I
hear a playing upon the flute. It is a fragmentary
air but vigorous and sweet, and it
brings me, dropping through the vast and
purple spaces of the evening, the most
charming sensation. For it is not a Secretary
to the Government of India who performs,
nor any member of the choir invisible
that sings hosannas over there to the Commander-in-Chief,
but a simple hill-man who
would make a melody because it is spring,
and he has perchance been given leave to
go and marry himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter IV</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PEOPLE are often removed from
their proper social spheres in this
world and placed in others which
they think lower and generally
less worthy of them. Their distant and
haughty behaviour under these circumstances
is rather, I am afraid, like my own
conduct at present, down in the world as I
am and reduced to the society of a garden.
I, too, have been looking about me with
contemptuous indifference, returning no
visits, though quantities of things have been
coming up to see me, and perpetually referring
to the superior circles I moved in when
I knew better days and went out to dinner.
You may notice, however, that such persons
generally end by condescending to the
simpler folk they come to live among; it is
dull work subsisting upon the most glorious
reminiscences and much wiser to become the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
shining ornament of the more limited sphere
to which one may be transferred. That is
the course I am considering, for whom cards
of invitation are dead letters, and to whom
the gay world up here will soon refer I have
no doubt, as the late Mrs. Tiglath-Pileser
who chose so singularly to bestow her remains
in a garden, though I am really alive
and flourishing there. I can never be the
shining ornament of my garden because
nature intended otherwise and there is too
much competition, but I may be able to
exert an improving influence. It is not impossible,
either, that I may find the horticultural
class about me more interesting
than I find myself. I have been accustomed
to speak with quite the ordinary contempt
of persons who have “no resources within
themselves”—in future I shall have more
sympathy and less ridicule for such. I
should rather like to know what one is expected
to possess in the way of “resources”
tucked away in that vague interior which we
are asked to believe regularly pigeon-holed
and alphabetically classified. We do believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
it—by an effort of the imagination—but
only try, on a fine day out-of-doors, to rummage there.
Your boasted brain is a perfect
rag-bag, a waste-paper basket, a bran pie
from which you draw at hazard an article
value a penny-ha’penny. This is disappointing
and humiliating when both you
and your family believe that you have only
to think in order to be quite indifferent to the
world and vastly entertained. “Resources”
somehow suggests the things one has read,
and I know I depended largely upon certain
poets, not one of whom will come near me
unless I go personally and bring him from
the bookshelves in his covers. Pope for
one—why Pope I cannot say, unless because
he would blink and cough and be
fundamentally miserable in a garden—great
breadths of Pope I thought would visit me
in quotation. Not a breadth. Immortals
of earlier and later periods are equally shy;
I catch at their fluttering garments and they
are off, leaving a rag in my hand. Only
that agreeable conceit of Marvell’s comes
and stays,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Annihilating all that’s made</div>
<div class="verse">To a green thought in a green shade,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>and I am ashamed to look it in the face—I
have positively worked it to death.</p>

<p>Apply within for lofty sentiments or profound
conclusions, the result is the same:
these things fly the ardent seeker and only
appear when you are not looking for them.
Instead you find shreds of likes and dislikes,
the ghost of an opinion you held last
week, a desire to know what time it is. My
regrettable experience is that you can explore
the recesses of your soul out-of-doors in
much less than a week if you put your mind
to it, with surprise and indignation that you
should find so little there.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“You beat your pate and fancy wit will come;</div>
<div class="verse">Knock as you please, there’s nobody at home.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Dear me, there’s Mr. Pope, and very much,
as usual, to the point! No, resources are
things you can lay your hands upon, and I
have come to believe that they are all in the
house.</p>

<p>Everything is up and showing, the garden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
is green with promise, but very few things
are quite ready for my kind advances; very
few things are out. What a pretty idea, by
the way, in that common little word as the
flowers use it! Out of the damp earth and
the green sheath, out into the sun with the
others, out to meet the bees and to snub the
beetles,—oh, <i>out</i>! When young girls
emerge into the world they too are “out”—the
word was borrowed, of course, from
the garden; its propriety is plain. Thisbe,
I remember, is out this season; but I do
not see anything in the borders exactly like
Thisbe. Doubtless later on her prototype
will come, in June I think, unfolding a pink
petal-coat. There is no hurry; it is yet only
the second week in April and these grey
mountains are still delicate and dim under
the ideal touch of the wild apricot and plum.
The borders may be empty, but there is
sweet vision to be had by looking up, and
just a hint of nature’s possible purposes with
a khud. It now occurs to me that there
ought to be clouds and clouds of this pink
and white blossoming all about the house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
behind as well as before, on each of our
several declivities,—there ought to be and
there is not. I remember now why there is
not. One crisp morning last autumn Tiglath-Pileser,
who is a practical person, was
struck by the fact, though it is not a new
one, that wild fruit trees may be made to
cultivate fruit by the process of grafting, and
announced his intention to graft largely.
“Think,” said he, “of the satisfaction of
being able to write home to England that
you are gathering from your own trees quantities
of the greengages which they pay tenpence
a pound for and place carefully in
tarts!”</p>

<p>The proceeding had not my approval. It
seemed to me that it would be a good deal
of trouble and care and thought and anxiety
to grow greengages on a khud, and we had
none of these things to spare. Neither
would there be any satisfaction in gathering
quantities of them when one could buy a
convenient number in the bazaar. We could
not eat them all, and it was not our walk in
life to sell such things; we might certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
expect to be cheated. We should be reduced
to making indiscriminate presents of
them and receiving grateful notes from people
we probably couldn’t bear. Or possibly
I, like the enterprising heroine of improving
modern fiction, would feel compelled to start
a jam factory, and did I strike him, Tiglath-Pileser,
as a person to bring a jam factory
to a successful issue? At the moment, I
remember, an accumulation of greengages
seemed the one thing I precisely couldn’t
and wouldn’t tolerate, but I didn’t say very
much, hardly more than I have mentioned,
as the supreme argument failed to occur to
me at the time. The supreme argument,
which only visits you after watching the pink
and white petals drop among the deodars for
hours together, is, of course, that if you can
afford to grow fruit to look at it is utilitarian
folly to turn it into fruit to eat. So I have
no doubt he had his way.... I have been
to see; it is the case. Where there should
be masses of delicate bloom there are stumps,
bare attenuated stumps, tied up in poultices
with fingers sticking out of them, which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
suppose are the precious grafts. Well, the
devil enters into each of us in his own guise;
I shall warn Tiglath-Pileser particularly to
beware of him in the form of a market
gardener.</p>

<p>I cannot conscientiously pass over the
rhododendrons, which are all aloft and ablaze
just now. It would be unkind and ungrateful
when they have come of their own accord
to grow on my khud and make it in places
really magnificent, though they arouse in me
no sentiment at all and I had just as soon
they went somewhere else. At home the
rhododendron is a bush on a lawn; here it
grows into a forest tree, and when you come
upon it far out in the wilds with the sun
shining through its red clusters against the
vivid blue it stands like candelabra lighted to
the glory of the Lord. I will consent to
admire it in that office, but for common human
garden uses I find it a little over-superb
and very disconcerting to the apricots and
plums. Also Thisbe will put it about in
bowls, and will not see that its very fitness
for sanctuary purposes makes it worse than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
useless on the end of a piano. To begin
with, its name is against it. Philologically
speaking you might as well put a hippopotamus
in a vase as a rhododendron. Apart
from that it sulks in the house and huddles
into bunches of red cotton. It misses the
sun in its veins, I suppose, and its spiky cup
of leaves, and its proper place in the world
at the end of a branch. The peony, which
it is a little like, is much better behaved in
a drawing-room, but then it has a leg to
stand on; we all want that. Besides, a peony
is a peony, which reminds me that I have
never seen one in Simla. It seems to have
been left at home by design in the general
emigration of English flowers, like an unattractive
old maid whom it was not worth
while to bring. But taste and fashion change,
and I see a spot where a large bunch of
peonies would be both comfortable and delectable.
It is not, after all, only slim young
things that are to be desired in society or in
a garden. Firm, fine high-coloured madames
with ample skirts and ripe experience are
often much more worth cultivating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Ah! they hold me, even in imagination,
the dear old peonies! Always they were the
first, in a certain garden of early colonial
fashion that I used to know in Canada, after
the long hard winter was past, to push their
red-green beginnings up into the shabby
welcome of the month of March. We used
to look for them under the wet black fallen
leaves before a sign had come upon the
apple-trees, before anything else stirred or
spoke at all; and how tender is one’s grown-up
affection for a thing which bound itself
together like that with one’s childish delight
in the first happy vibration of the spring!
Here, after all these many springs and half
across the world, here on my remote and
lofty shelf where no one lives but Aryans
and officials, I want them to come up again
that way, and if they have not forgotten
the joy of it perhaps I too shall remember.
Atma having no objection, I will send to
England for some peonies.</p>

<p>Everything is green except the forget-me-nots,
they are very blue indeed in thick
borders along both sides of the drive; sweet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
they look, like narrow streams reflecting the
sky in the middle of the garden. Do not
gather the forget-me-not, it is a foolish inert
little nonentity in the hand, it has not even
character enough for a button-hole, but in
the bosom of its family it is delightful. Atma
is very pleased with these borders; it is
the first time he has had them so long and
so gay. “How excellent this season,” says
he in his own tongue, “are the giftie-noughts
of we people.” I told you he was a man of
parts; it is not easy to be a poet in another
language.</p>

<p>Also, I perceive, there are periwinkles on
the khud.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter V</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was an event this morning when Thalia
came whisking along the Mall in
her rickshaw and turned in here.
The Mall, I should mention, is the
only road in Simla that has a name. It is a
deplorably inappropriate name, it makes you
think of sedan-chairs and elderly beaux and
other things that have never appeared upon
the Himalayas, and it was doubtless given in
derision, but it has stuck fast like many another
poor old joke until at last people take
it seriously and forget that it ever pretended
to be humorous. I don’t even know
whether it is more fashionable to live upon
the Mall than elsewhere, or whether one
can claim to live upon it when it runs past
one’s attic windows like an elevated railway;
but we have often remarked to one another
that if we cannot be said to live upon the
Mall we cannot be said to live anywhere and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
taken what comfort may be had out of that.
Our peculiar situation has at all events the
advantage that I can always see Thalia coming,
which adds the pleasure of anticipation
to her most unexpected visit. Like most
of us, Thalia arrives with the season, but it
should be added that she brings the season
with her. We amuse ourselves a good deal,
for a serious community, with a toy theatre,
in which we present Mr. Jones and Mr. Pinero
so intelligently that I often wonder why
neither of these playwrights has yet come
out to ascertain what he is really capable of.
Thalia is our leading comedienne; you
would have guessed that by her name. She
is never too soon anywhere, but I had begun
to wonder when she was coming up.
“Up,” of course, means up from the plains,—up
from the Pit, as its present temperature
quite permits me to explain. April is the
last month in which you can leave the Pit
without being actually scorched.</p>

<p>“What <i>are</i> you doing here?” she exclaimed,
half-way down the drive. She expected,
I suppose, to find me in the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
trying to decide upon the shade of this year’s
cheese-cloth curtains. By the way, I have
decided—that the old ones will do. Thisbe
doesn’t mind, and I’ve got the clouds.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m just here,” I said with nonchalance.
There is nothing like nonchalance
to prove superiority to circumstances.
“How are you?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Thalia. “Well, come
along in. I’ve got quantities of things
to talk about.”</p>

<p>“It is very good of you,” I returned, “to
press my hospitality upon me, but I don’t
go in. I stay out. If Tiglath-Pileser saw
me entering the house at this hour,” I continued
with the vulgarity which we permit
ourselves to the indulgent ear of a friend,
“it would be as much as my place is worth.
But you see I have a chair ready for emergencies—pray
sit down. You are the first
emergency that has arisen, I mean that has
dropped in, this year.”</p>

<p>When I had fully explained, as I was at
once of course compelled to do, with a
wealth of detail and much abuse of Tiglath-Pileser,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> 
I was not gratified with the effect
upon Thalia. “You have simply been
spending your time out-of-doors,” said she,
“a very ordinary thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Try it,” said I.</p>

<p>“And are you better?”</p>

<p>“I think,” I replied, “that I have possibly
gained a little weight. But I might as
well admit it cheerfully, they won’t take my
word against any pair of scales.”</p>

<p>“That was an excellent prescription I
sent you in October,” Thalia continued reproachfully.
“You haven’t given it up?”</p>

<p>“It has given me up,” I responded
promptly, “after the first three weeks it declined
to have anything whatever to say to
me. And besides, it had to be taken in
decreasing doses. Now if a thing is really
calculated to do you good it should be taken
in increasing doses. That is why I begin to
have some little confidence in this out-of-doors
business. Every day I feel equal to
a little more of it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Thalia, “Mrs. Lyric told
me that it had made another woman of her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
And Colonel Lyric commands the 10th
Pink Hussars.”</p>

<p>Thalia knows it annoys me to be told
about a woman, with any sort of significance,
what position her husband occupies in the
world, and that is the reason she does it.
I do not say that it has no weight as a contributory
fact in a general description, but I
do say that an improper amount of importance
is usually attached to it. You ask
what kind of a person Mrs. Thom is, and
you are told, “Oh, Mr. Thom is Chief Secretary
in the Department of Thuggi and
Dacoity,” being expected without further
ado to dispose yourself to love her if she
will let you. One is always inclined to say
“But she may be very nice in spite of that,”
and one only refrains because one knows
how scandal grows in Simla. And there are
people in these parts, I assure you, who
would run to take a prescription because
it had made another woman of the wife
of the colonel commanding the 10th Pink
Hussars, no matter what kind of a woman
she had been before; but I was not going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
to gratify Thalia by letting her see that I
knew it.</p>

<p>“At all events,” I said calmly, “it had to
be taken in decreasing doses and naturally it
came to an end. Are you settled in?”</p>

<p>“I have a roof to cover me,” said Thalia
sententiously, “and for that,” she added
looking round, “I didn’t know how thankful
I was. But I am undergoing repairs.
They are putting mud into the cracks of my
dwelling, paperhangers are impending, and
this morning arrived three whitewashers. I
wanted to be done with it at once, so I sent
for three. I told them I was in a hurry.
In one breath, they said, it should be done,
and sat down in the verandah <i>to make their
brushes</i>. It’s a fact. Of split bamboo.
You can <i>not</i> hustle the East. But I found
I had to come away.”</p>

<p>“How foolish it all seems!” I sighed with
an eye upon the farther hills. “Shouldn’t
you like to see my pansies?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied resignedly, “I suppose I
must see your pansies,” and where I led she
followed me, still babbling of paperhangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>It is no exaggeration to say that during
the months of April, May, and June, there
are more pansies than people in this town.
(Upon second thoughts why should it be an
exaggeration, since in every garden inhabited
by two or three persons there are hundreds
of pansies.) They seem to like the official
atmosphere, doubtless in being so high and
dry it suits them; at all events they adapt
themselves to it with less fuss than almost
any other flower. And certainly they could
teach individuality to most of our worthy
bureaucrats, who have a way of coming up,
they, exactly like each other. Pansies from
the same parent root naturally look alike,
but if you really scan their features there is
not the least resemblance between families.
I have been living principally in their fellowship
for several days and I quite feel that
my knowledge of human nature is extended.
There never was such variety of temperament
in any community; to describe it
would be to write a list of all the adjectives
yet invented to bear upon character, a
tedious task. It is positively a relief after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the slight monotony of a society in which
everybody is paid by the Queen, to meet
persons like pansies, who aren’t paid by
anybody, and who express themselves, in
consequence, with the utmost facility and
freedom. (Thalia, who is the wife of the
Head of a Department, here interrupted me
to ask what I could possibly mean.) Oh
there is no charm like spontaneity, in idea,
behaviour, or looks. The Dodos of London
society triumph by it, while self-conscious
people of vast intellectual resources
are considered frumps.</p>

<p>I imparted all this to Thalia, and she
agreed with me.</p>

<p>You see these things in a pansy, and a
great deal more—station in life, religious
convictions almost—but try to focus your
impression, try to analyze the blooming
countenance that looks up into yours, and
the result is fugitive and annoying. Not a
feature will bear inspection; instantly they
vanish, magically, as if ashamed of the likeness
you look for, and leave you contemplating
just a flower, with petals. You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
noticed that in a pansy. It is better, if you
wish to enjoy yourself among them, to take
them with a light and passing regard, and
privately add them to the agreeable things
of life that will not bear looking into.</p>

<p>I here asked Thalia if she thought they
did better from seeds or from roots, and she
said she didn’t know.</p>

<p>One often hears the German language
complimented on its pretty name for pansies,
<i>Stiefmütterchen</i>, but it is very indiscriminating.
They are by no means all little
stepmothers; some of them wear beards
and I wish they wouldn’t, for a beard is a
loathly thing in nature or on men. Also
the personation that goes on among them is
really reprehensible; one can find pansy
photographs of any number of people.
One irascible and impossible old retired
colonel in England is always appearing, to
my great satisfaction and delight. The
original would be so vastly annoyed to
know how often he comes out to see me
here, and how amiable and interesting I find
him, for we are not good friends, and I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
sure he would not dream of calling in the
flesh. It is an old story among us, but I
was surprised to find Atma, too, impressed
with this likeness to the human family. I
asked him the other day why some pansies
were so big and others so little. He considered
for a moment and then he said with
the smiling benevolence which we extend to
the intelligence of the young, “Like people
they come—some are born to be large and
some to be small. As Sropo and Masuddi.”
Atma is really the interpreter of this garden.</p>

<p>Thalia again interrupted me to ask why it
was not possible this season, when purple
was so popular, to find in the shops anything
as royal as the colour a certain pansy
was wearing. I said the reason was probably
lost in science, but she immediately
supplied it herself, as I have noticed my
sex is prone to do in searching for general
explanations. “Of course,” she said, “one
must remember that they grow their own
clothes. If we could only do that! The
repose of being quite certain that nobody else
had your pattern!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“They would take too long,” I objected.
“This poor thing has spent three-quarters
of her life making her frock, and
now she can only wear it for about three
days.”</p>

<p>But Thalia seemed pleased with the idea.
“Think how original I could make my
gowns in <i>Lady Thermidore</i>,” she said pensively.</p>

<p>“And you would perish with your design!”
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No,” she cried luminously, “I should
reappear in another character!”</p>

<p>I have often noticed how radical is the
effect of play-acting upon the human mind.
Your play-actress throws herself naturally
into every character she meets. I could see
that it was giving Thalia hardly any trouble
to transform herself into a pansy.</p>

<p>We went back to the chairs and sat down,
but not for long. Consulting her watch,
my friend announced that she must be
off, she was going to lunch at Delia’s. “At
Delia’s!” I remarked. “How people are
swallowed up in their houses, to be sure!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
You would be more polite to say ‘at Delia.’
It’s bad habit, this living in houses.”</p>

<p>“I think,” she responded, “that you are
losing your social graces. I had quantities
of things to tell you, and I am taking them
away untold. The garden is too vague a
place to receive in. However, never mind,
I will try to come again. Your flowers are
charming, but it has not been what I call a
satisfactory visit. I hope I haven’t bored
you.”</p>

<p>“How can you say so!” I cried; “I have
enjoyed it immensely,” and I tucked her
affectionately into her rickshaw and sped her
on her way. When she had well started I
remembered something, and ran after her.</p>

<p>“Well?” she demanded, all interest and
curiosity.</p>

<p>“It was only to ask you,” I said breathlessly,
“if you had noticed what a large
number of pansies look like Mr. Asquith?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VI</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is a dull and serious day. As my
family declare that I have become a
mere barometer of my former self,
this will perhaps be, but I am not
certain, a dull and serious chapter. There
are no clouds, there is only a prevailing
opaqueness, which shuts down just beyond
the nearest ranges, letting through an unpleasant
general light that makes the place
look like a bad, hard, lumpish study in oils.
The stocks, which have come out very elegantly
since last week, have a disappointed
air and the pansies are positively lugubrious.
Only the tall field-daisies and the snapdragons
seem not to mind. They plainly
preach and as plainly practise the philosophy
of flowers taking what they can get in the
hope of better things. Like most philosophers
in a small way, however, they are not
over-distressed with sensibility on their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
part, and I cannot see why they should take
it upon themselves to cheer up any of the
rest of us.</p>

<p>I have asked Sropo whether it is going
to rain. “Mistress,” he replied, “how
should I know?” “Worthy one,” said I,
“you have lived in these parts for twenty
years. What manner of owl are you that
to you it does not appear whether or not it
will rain?” “Mistress,” quoth he, with his
throaty chuckle, “the rajah-folk themselves
do not know this thing.”</p>

<p>I do not think, myself, that we shall have
anything so pleasant as rain. The day is
too dispirited for weeping; it will perform its
appointed task and go to bed. I have not
in months encountered a circumstance, an
associate or a prescription so lowering as the
present morning. Coming out as usual,
quite prepared to be agreeable, it has given
me the cold shoulder and the sulky nod.
For two pins I would go back into the
house and take every flower I could gather
with me.</p>

<p>Cometh the postman, advancing down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
drive. Always an interest attaches to the
postman; he is like to-morrow, you never
know what he may bring, but he loses half
his charm and all his dignity when deprived
of his rat-tat-tat. Government makes up
for it to some extent by dressing him in a
red flannel coat with a leather belt and bare
legs, but he can never acquire his proper
and legitimate warning for the simple reason
that the houses of this country have neither
knockers nor bells. How sharply different
are the ways in which people account for
themselves in this world! It is one of the
poignancies of life. This Punjabi postman
earns his living by putting one foot before
another—it comes to that—in the diverse
interests of the community, and you never
saw anybody look more profoundly bored
with other people’s affairs. I earn mine—or
would if it were not for Tiglath-Pileser—by
looking carefully in the back of my head
for foolish things to write about a garden.
It is a method so much pleasanter that my
compassion for the postman has a twinge of
scruple in it for my lighter lot. That I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
nothing in the world to do with the arrangement
does not somehow make me quite
happy about it—the fact is that to be logical
is not always to be happy. I can only
hope that if the postman and I meet again
in the progress of eternity I shall find him
composing poems.</p>

<p>He has brought nothing to speak of, only
the daily newspaper published at Lahore.
That in itself is sufficiently curious, to live
in a place where the morning paper is
published at Lahore. Still stranger, to the
western mind, may be the thought—of a
journal produced in Allahabad. Allahabad,
as a centre of journalistic enterprise, has the
glamour of comic opera. Yet Allahabad
has its newspaper, and they print it very
nicely too. However, it would be ridiculous
to write an essay upon Indian journalism
merely because a Punjabi postman has
brought in a newspaper.</p>

<p>That a day like this should sound another
minor note is almost a thing to cry out
against, yet it is on such days that they rise
and swell in a perfect diapason of misery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
When the sun withdraws itself from the
human consciousness things come up, I
suppose, from underneath. In the gaiety
of yesterday perhaps I should not have seen
the coolie with the charcoal; he would have
passed naturally among the leaf-shadows,
a thing to be taken for granted. To-day
he hurts. His bag of charcoal is deplorably
heavy; he bends forward under it so far
that he has to lift his head to see beyond
him, and every muscle strains and glistens
to carry it. His gait under his load is slow
and uncertain and tentative, and I know it
has brought him to the wrong house; we
are supplied for months with charcoal.</p>

<p>He has stopped to ask, and I find that
he has come quite a mile out of his way to
this mistake. With patience and submission
when I explained, he shifted his load
and turned from me toward the deferred relief,
the further limit. The human beast of
burden is surely the summing-up of pathos—free
and enviable are all others compared
with him. So heavy a toil fills one with
righteous anger against the inventor, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
primitive a task humiliates one for the
race. Niggardly, niggardly is the heritage
of Adam’s sons. I must see that man
straighten his back.... There is no harm
done; you cannot have too much charcoal.</p>

<p>One questions, on such a day, whether it
is quite worth while, this attempt by the assistance
of nature to live a little longer. I
myself am almost convinced that persons
afflicted with the gift of sympathy would be
wise to perish easily and soon, and should
be willing to do so, instead of throwing
themselves in the lap of the mother of us
all beseeching a few more years and promising
to be very, very good and try to deserve
them. Why protract, at the expense of upsetting
all your habits and customs, an acute
sense of undeserved superiority to coolies
and postmen; why by taking infinite pains
and indefinite air prolong existence based on
such a distressing perception, when by going
on with almost any good prescription you
are pretty certain reasonably soon to take
your comfortable place in the only democracy
which, so far as we know, is a practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
working success? For there is neither class
nor competition nor capital, nor any kind of
advantage in the grave whither thou goest,
but one indisputable dead level of condition
and experience, with peace and freedom from
the curse of evolution; not even the fittest
survive.</p>

<p>Comfortable persons like, oh several I
could mention, who have no way of walking
with another postman’s legs or bending with
another coolie’s back and who cannot understand
why this should be called a distressful
world which provides them regularly with
tea and muffins, should go on naturally, to
the end. They have their indifferent prototypes
among the vegetables; though I
have noticed that most flowers look with
the eye of compassion upon life. They
follow the simple lines upon which they
were created, by which to live and not to
observe is the chief end of man; there are a
great many of them, thousands, in their protective
skins all over the world; and they
are only interesting of course to each other.
Nevertheless no one should speak slightingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
of them, for we all number them
among our friends and relations, and constantly
go and stay with them. Besides, I
did not set out to be disagreeable at anybody’s
expense. It was only borne in upon
me that for us, the unhappy minority who
have two sets of nerves, one for our own
use and one at the disposal of every human
failure by the wayside, the world is not likely
to become a pleasanter place the longer one
stays in it. If continual dropping will wear
away a stone, continual rubbing will wear
away a skin, and happy is he or she, after
sixty or seventy years’ contact with the misery
of life, who arrives at the grave with a
whole one.</p>

<p>I do not deny that there are poultices.
One of them is a thing Tiglath-Pileser
sometimes says—that it is stupid to talk
about the aggregate of human woe, since all
the pain as well as all the pleasure of the
world is summed up in the individual and
limited by him. A battle is really no more
than the killing of a soldier, a famine is
comprised in a death by starvation. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
unit of experience refuses to merge in the
mass; you cannot multiply beyond one. I
do not think much of this emollient, but
such as it is I will apply it if another coolie
comes in with charcoal.</p>

<p>Seriously speaking, when your time comes—I
hope this makes nobody uncomfortable,
but I never can understand why one should
shirk the subject instead of regarding it
with the interest and curiosity it naturally
inspires—when your time goes, rather, and
leaves you confronted with that vast eternity
so full of unimaginably agreeable possibilities,
which of all the parts and members
that make up you, shall you be most sorry
to relinquish? I do not refer to obscure
organs such as the heart and lungs, which
you never notice except when they are giving
trouble, but the willing agents by which
you keep in touch with the world. I am
very fond of them all, I am so accustomed
to their ways and they know so exactly what
I like; I could not dismiss any of them
without regret, but I find degrees in the
distressful anticipation. One’s eyes, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
instance, have given one more and keener
pleasure certainly, than any other organ;
but I could close my eyes. One’s ears have
registered all the voices one loves, and the
sound of rain and the wind among the pines,
but there is such a din in this world besides
that very gladly I could close my ears.
One’s feet have been most willing servitors,
but one sees so little of them—would you
recognize a photograph of your own foot?
For me it is the most grievous thing to
think that one will be obliged to abandon
one’s hands. One’s hands are more than
servants, they are friends. One holds them
in respect and admiration and personal affection,
and in the end is not what we write upon
them the very summing-up of ourselves?
And from the first spoon they carry to our
infant lips to the adult irritation they work
off by tapping on the table how much they
have done for one! Above all things I
shall miss my hands if I have to do without
them, and I shall be profoundly resentful,
though I may not show it, when somebody
else takes the liberty of folding them for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>Thisbe, coming out to say that she has
neuralgia, and will I ever come in to tea,
demands to know what I have written there.
I shall not tell Thisbe; it is a melancholy
of mine own, compounded of many simples.
Moreover, she would report it to Tiglath-Pileser,
and they would take measures; I
should be lucky to get off with an iron
tonic.</p>

<p>“Nothing about you, Thisbe.”</p>

<p>But in order to ascertain what I really
have said about her,—she has a hatred of
publicity and I have to be very careful,—she
goes privily when I am immersed in tea,
and possesses herself of the whole.</p>

<p>“But you are not going to die,” she
exclaimed with dismay and disapproval.
“We have made quite other arrangements.
You can’t possibly die, now.”</p>

<p>“Not immediately, in so far as I am
aware,” I respond. “But there is no harm
in looking forward to it a little,—on a day
like this.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VII</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE are many methods of
gardening. I have known people
who were not content with
anything but actually digging
and weeding, grubbing up the curly wet
worms and the tough roots, and bending
their own backs over bulbs and seedlings.
That is the thorough method, and though
it is a little like sweeping and scrubbing out
yourself the rooms your guests are to occupy,—and
I suppose that would be a pleasure
to some people,—it is the method that
commands the most respect. Compared
with it I feel that I cannot ask respect for
mine; I must be content with admiration.
My gardening is done entirely with scissors,
scissors and discretion, both easy to use.
With scissors and discretion I walk about
my garden, snipping off the flowers that are
over. Masuddi comes behind, holding my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
umbrella, Sropo with a basket picks up the
devoted heads. I thus ignore causes and
deal directly with results, much the simplest
and quickest way when life is complicated
by its manifold presentations and the cares
of a family. And the results are wonderful,—I
can heartily recommend this method of
gardening to any one who wants to compass
the most charming effect with the least
exertion. A plant is only a big bouquet,
and what bouquet does not instantly redouble
its beauty when you take away the one or
two flowers that have withered in it? A
faded flower is too sad a comment upon life
to be allowed to remain even on its parent
stem, besides being detrimental and untidy
like a torn petticoat. There should be
nothing but joy in the garden, joy and freshness
and coquetry, and the subtlest, loveliest
suggestion of art; anon by the diligent
application of scissors and discretion I leave
a flood of these things behind me every day.
No doubt it is regrettable that the withered
rags in Sropo’s basket represent the joy and
coquetry of yesterday; this is the lesson of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
life, however, and one cannot take account
of everything. Also you lay yourself open
to the charge of being a mere lady’s-maid to
your garden; but worse things than that are
said about nearly everybody.</p>

<p>Among the pansies I confess I feel rather
an executioner with my scissors, though there
a rigorous policy most rewards me. Nothing
is so slatternly as a pansy bed where some
of the family are just coming out into the
world, and others are beginning to weary of
it and others are going shamelessly to seed.
My pansies must all be properly coiffured
and fit to appear in society; when they begin
to pull shawls over their heads and take
despondent views I remove them. Moreover,
under this unremitting discipline, they
will go on and on, I shall have four months
of pansies; it is in every way the right thing
to do.</p>

<p>And yet it is a remorseless business, turning
up the little faces to see if they have
lived long enough to be ready for the guillotine.
They look straight <i>at</i> you, and some
of them shrink and some beseech, and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
are mutely resigned. I am no stern Atropos,
I am weak before the fate I bring and
often let it go; and if by mistake I snip
off a bud I hurry on and try to forget it.
Has the divinity who lays us low also, I
wonder, his moments of compunction—does
he ever hold his hand and say “One
more day”? Or does he snip here and there
at random “just choosing so”? Oh Setebos,
Setebos, and Setebos, I do not like your
rôle, I am glad I am not an omnipotent
Whim; I hope my garden thinks better of
me than that. The prevailing expression
among pansies, by the way, is that of apprehension;
I hope this is a botanical fact and
not confined to my pansies.</p>

<p>Nothing is more annoying in a small way
in this world than to see your tastes reflected
in those whom you consider inferior to yourself.
You would rather not share anything
with such persons, even a preference. I
have to submit to this vexation. There are
others hereabouts, whom I have got into the
habit of looking down upon, who have exactly
my idea of gardening. I hasten to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
that they are not people in the ordinary
sense of the term. Bold, indeed, would be
the non-official worm, in this bureaucratic
stronghold, who should point to any gazetted
creature about him and say “That is a lesser
thing than I.” Society would smile and
decline to be deceived. For this is an ordered
Olympus, the gods go in to dinner by
Regulation, their rank and pay is published
in Kalends which anybody may buy, and
the senior among them are diligently worshipped
by the junior as “brass hats.” No,
it would certainly not be for the Tiglath-Pilesers
who never sent back a parcel to the
draper’s tied up in red tape in their lives,
not having a yard of it in the house for any
purpose, to give themselves airs over persons
who use it every day. But even a
non-official may look down upon a monkey.
My offensive imitators are monkeys.</p>

<p>I would not object if they followed my
example in their own jungle garden, but they
come and do it in mine. Be sure I never
catch them at it. When I am operating
there myself they often leap crashing into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the rhododendrons on the khud and sit
among the branches watching me, whole
troops of them, but at a stone or a compliment
they are off, bounding with childish
unintelligible curses down the khud. It is
in the early dawn before any one is awake
or about, that they come with freedom and
familiarity to walk where I walk and do as
I do. I can perfectly fancy them mincing
along in impertinent caricature—I do not
mince—holding up their tails with one hand
and with the other catching and clawing haphazard
at the flowers as they imagine I do.
Two hours later, when I come out to mourn
and storm over the withering fragments on
the drive not a monkey vexes the horizon.
And they do what some people think worse
than this. They come and tear Tiglath-Pileser’s
carefully bound grafts from their
adopted stems, and the young shoots from
his little new apple-trees which have travelled
all the way from England to live here
with us and share our limitations and our
shelf. These were only planted in February,
and one of them, a beginner not three feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
high, had six of its very own apples on it
yesterday. It is not a thing that happens
often, apples as soon as that, and six; and
Simla is a place where there is so little going
on that we were more excited about them,
perhaps, than you would be at home. They
were small apples but they had to grow, and
they were growing yesterday. This morning
while we still dreamed of our apples, a
grey langur with a black face ate the whole
crop at a sitting. So now we can neither
bake them nor boil them nor measure them
for publication. They have disappeared in
a grey langur with a black face, and though I
heartily hope they will inconvenience him I
have very little expectation of it; the
punitive laws of nature matter little to
monkeys.</p>

<p>The jungle is full of wild fruit trees newly
burgeoned, but the monkeys prefer the cultivated
varieties, they have found out the
improved flavour even in the young leaves.
They find out everything, not merely for
the purposes of honest burglary, but for the
cynical satisfaction of tearing it to pieces.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Thus, for one graft that a monkey devours,
he pulls three out of their bandages and
casts them on the ground, where they are
of no further use to either men or monkeys.
What you plant with infinite pains they pull
up by the roots. “These people have done
something; let us undo it,” is the one thought
they ever think,—which shows, I suppose,
that if there are politics among them they
govern strictly on party lines. It makes one
very ill-disposed toward them. A monkey
has entered the pantry and bolted with a jam-pot
even while my back was turned giving
out the sugar to make more jam. A monkey
has come in at the verandah door and
abstracted <i>all</i> the bread and butter for afternoon
tea, while his accomplice sat upon the
paling to gibber “Cave!” This was legitimate
larceny, and we put up with it. Thisbe
said the poor monkey looked hungry, and
she would be content with Madeira cake,
adding, out of the depths of her experience,
that it was a pity the monkey that took the
jam hadn’t taken the bread and butter too,—they
went so well together. We can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
indulgent to an entirely empty monkey; we
have enough in common with him to understand
his behaviour, and his villainous pirate’s
descent upon us is always good comedy.
But when he picks the slates off the roof of
your dwelling, when he privily enters your
husband’s dressing-room and abstracts the
razor and strop—Tiglath-Pileser, who would
not lend his to a seraph!—what kind of
patience is there which would be equal to
the demand? Monkeys do not throw stones
and break windows; one wishes they would,
since that would bring them within the cognizance
of the police and it might then be
possible to deal with them. A monkey
would hate solitary confinement above all
things. Often in a troupe bounding from
tree to tree overhead across the Mall there
will be one with a collar and a bit of rope or
chain hanging to it, escaped from capture and
free again to range with his fellows the limitless
lunatic asylum the good God has endowed
for him in the jungle. Once he became
amenable to that sort of punishment he
would forsake for ever, I am sure, the haunts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
of men; but he is not intelligent enough, or
perhaps he is too intelligent.</p>

<p>There are so many of them. A monkey
census is obviously impossible, but I believe
if it could be taken it would show that every
resident official had at least one simian counterpart,—a
statement which I hope will not
give offence on either side. An old fakir
on the top of Jakko keeps a kind of retreat
for monkeys, a monastery with the most
elastic rules, where indeed the domestic relations
are rather encouraged than forbidden.
He is their ghostly father, though responsibility
for their morals seems to sit upon him
lightly; he will call them out of the jungle
for you in hundreds to be fed. Then you
give him four annas and come away. A
pious Hindoo, with sins to expiate, would
doubtless give more, and the fakir would
profess to spend it in grain for the monkeys.
Here, by the way, we have an explanation
of the incorrigibility of monkeys which has
not hitherto occurred to ethnographers: they
consume all the sins of the pious Hindoos.
So they thrive and multiply and gambol all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
over this town of Simla, its house-tops and
shop-fronts, its gardens and its public places,
with none to make them afraid. There are
two small brown ones sitting on the paling
looking at me at this moment, knowing perfectly
well that I will never interrupt the
flow of my ideas to get up and chase them
away.</p>

<p>Of course we try to make Atma responsible,
and he declares that he persecutes them
without ceasing, but we know better. He
claps his hands at them and shouts, “Go,
brother!” and that is all he does. And
brother goes, to the next convenient branch.
We have given Atma catapults and he tells
us that he uses them every morning before
our honours are awake, but we are certain that
he hangs them on a nail. And indeed I do
not think monkeys would be very shy of a
house defended by mere catapults. Atma,
however, has taken this business of Tiglath-Pileser’s
fruit trees seriously. He had carefully
protected every tree and graft with
thorns, but the monkeys slid their hands
in underneath, and reached up, and tore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
down the young shoots with great strips of
the tender bark as well. He was angry at
last, was Atma, and he asked for a gun.</p>

<p>“You would kill a monkey?” we exclaimed,
“you would break your one commandment?”
and Atma cast down his eyes.</p>

<p>“They are <i>budmash</i>,” said he (a wicked
and perverse generation), “and they eat the
work of we people. Why should they not
be killed?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the sahib, “you are a good
churchman”—or words to that effect—“I
know that you will not kill a monkey.”
And we both looked at him piercingly.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” said Atma, cheerfully
and shamelessly recanting, “it would be well
that a gun should be. A gun is a noise-making
thing. These <i>bundar</i>-people have
no shame, but it will appear to them that
here a gun is, and they will not come.
Also,” he added ferociously, “for that long-tail
apple-eating wallah, I will put a stone in
the gun.”</p>

<p>He had definite proposals to make about
the gun; it had plainly been weighed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
and considered, not being a matter to be
lightly undertaken. It would not be wise
for the sahib to buy it in Simla, where the
price would be great and the article probably
inferior. By our honours’ favour he,
Atma, would go to his own village, where
apparently they knew a thing or two about
guns, and where, since they were all poor
men, guns were also cheap, and there select
one for our approbation. If our honours’
liking was not, he added, the gun could be
sent back, but our honours’ liking would be.</p>

<p>“Where is your village, worthy one?”
asked Tiglath-Pileser.</p>

<p>Atma waved his arm across the purple
masses on the western horizon. “I will
come to it in three days,” he said, and
Tiglath-Pileser consented.</p>

<p>“He wants leave,” said the master. “The
gun is only a pretext, but it’s as good as a
dead grandmother any day. Let him go.”</p>

<p>But punctually on the evening of the
tenth day Atma returned from his village
shouldering a gun. Pride was in his port
and pleasure in his countenance. It was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
ancient muzzle-loader, respectable, useful,
strong, in no way to be compared to a dead
grandmother. The sahib gave it the honourable
attention which all sahibs have for
weapons of character, while Atma stood by
and spoke of it as it had been indeed a
relative.</p>

<p>“Behold it is a beautiful gun, and it shall
bring fear. Now I am but a gardener and
know nothing; but my father is a man with
understanding of all things, and though there
were five guns to be bought in the village,
he forbade the other four. My father
showed me how the ribs of this were thick
and its stomach was clean—is it so, sahib?—and
how it would speak well and loudly.
But the price is also great. Though my
father spoke for three hours, till he was in
anger, the price is also great.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Tiglath-Pileser.</p>

<p>“It could not be lessened,” said Atma
anxiously, “thirteen rupees.”</p>

<p>About seventeen and sixpence!</p>

<p>The gun speaks well and loudly, and the
monkeys are much entertained by it. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
make off at a report with a great jabber of
concern, but they have already discovered
that it is a mere expression of opinion, with
nothing in it to hurt, and they come back
when their nerves are soothed to hear it
again. They know that you cannot shoot
your own relations; they rest with confidence
upon the prehistoric tie, and oh, they
presume upon it! Too far, perhaps. There
is a broad-faced Thibetan in the bazaar, behind
whose cheerful grin I am sure no
conscience resides at all. Every year he
sells me pheasants and partridges which I
know he poaches from the Kingdom of
Patiala—I am sure he would pot a fellow-poacher
for a suitable consideration. When
I suggest this, however, Tiglath-Pileser asks
me if I like the idea of a hired assassin. I
do not like the idea. I would rather do it
myself, although even justifiable homicide has
never been a favourite amusement of mine.</p>

<p>Shoot a monkey? If it is a mother-monkey,
and the baby that clings between
her shoulders is a little one, you cannot
even throw a stone at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>I wonder if it is good for us to live among
them like this. I wonder whether the constant
spectacle of his original, glorious freedom
may not produce a tendency to revert
to his original habits even in a brass hat.
It is a futile speculation, but there is a thrill
in it. One would know him of course, by
the hat, and the bit of red tape hanging to
his collar....</p>

<p>What would you do about it—about this
plague, if it plagued you? And does it not
mark, like a picture in a book of travels, the
distance that lies between us, that I should
thus complain to you, not of sparrows or
foxes or rats or rabbits or any of the ordinary
pests of civilization, but of being overrun—simply
overrun—by monkeys!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THIS is going to be a day of roses,
a grand opening day. They have
been getting ready for weeks;
every morning there has been a
show of pink promises, half kept, white
hints and creamy suggestions, and here and
there a sweet full-blown advertisement; but
so much has been suddenly done that I
think the bushes must have sat up all night
to enable the garden definitely to make this
morning its chief summer announcement—the
roses are out. The shelf holds a great
many roses, its widest part indeed, where
the house stands, is quite taken up by a
large bed of them which was meant to be
oval, and only is not because no design in
this country can ever be described by even
an approximately exact term. That is at
the side of the house; the drive runs past it.
There is another bed, an attempted oblong,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
between the front door and the precipice by
way of being devoted to them, and beside
that they have made room for themselves
in all the borders where there may or may
not be accommodation for other people;
and they climb, as well, over every window
that looks out into the garden.</p>

<p>It is our privilege to entertain largely
among roses; I don’t believe there is
another shelf in Simla that holds so many.
And I will hasten to say this for them, that
in all my social experience they offer the
best example of hospitality being its own
reward, which, of course, goes without
saying; but it is difficult to sit down for the
first time in the year before the glory of the
roses, and refrain from offering them a politeness
of some sort, even one that might be
taken for granted. I will add a compliment
which is not perhaps quite so lamentably
obvious. There are people—moderns, decadents—who
will not subscribe to the paramountcy
of the rose. They produce other
flowers—hyacinths, violets, daffodils—to
which they attach the label of their poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
preference. I will not dispute any taste in
theory, but I will say this broad, general
thing which is evident and plain: once the
roses are in bloom, nothing else in the garden
matters. The rose may or may not
be queen, but when she appears the other
flowers dwindle into pretty little creatures of
no great pretension who may come out or
not at their convenience. You will admit
that if there is a rose in sight you do not
look at anything else. As to the daffodils,
they came up a month ago, and I cut them
and put them in the drawing-room and
thought no more about it.</p>

<p>So the garden for me this morning means
roses (dear me, yes, those Gloire de Dijons
alone command it for yards in every direction),
and the excitement of it, the pure keen
delicious excitement of it, makes me wonder
whether a simple life led in a cane chair
under a pencil-cedar is not a better background
for the minor sensations than the
most elaborate existence indoors. But that
is another truism; elaboration is always
bad, it prevents one’s seeing things. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
existence obscured by curtains and frescoed
with invitations from the Princess would
never, I am surely convinced, afford me the
exquisite joy and wonder, the sense of expanded
miracle, that reigns in me at this
moment. I must be allowed to say so,
though nothing, I know, is so dull as the
detailing of another person’s sensations. It
will be admitted that I do not often gush,
that is a claim I make with a good conscience;
and if I were forbidden to write
emotionally about roses this morning I
should simply not write at all, which would
be a breach of good manners and a loss of
time. If the truth were confessed, I have
wasted hours already congratulating them
upon their happy advent, I have been much
led away among them from my fountain
pen; idleness is so perfect with a rose.
After putting down that stupidity about
our hospitality being its own reward, I fell
into unnumbered asterisks, raptures in the
manner of M. Pierre Loti, and only refrained
from making them because one
would not gasp too obviously after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
master. And now that I have pulled my
chair into the thickest shade of the pencil-cedar—it
is little better after all than a
spoke to sit under, wheeling with the sun—and
am once more prepared to offer you my
best attention, down upon me descends
Delia, waving a parasol from afar. I must
introduce Delia; she is a vagabond and an
interruption, but I shall be extremely glad
to see her.</p>

<p>I wonder whether anybody has ever felt
the temptation of dealing quite honestly
with the thousand eyes that listen to him, and
putting in the interruptions as well as the
other full-stops that occur in the course of a
morning’s work in manuscript, saying in
brackets exactly where he was compelled to
leave off on account of a rose or a Delia.
One would then see precisely how far such a
one’s flight carried him, and how long, after
he had been brought to earth, it took his
beating pinions to regain the ether. One
might share his irritation at being interrupted,
or one might wish him interrupted oftener;
it would all depend. At all events it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
give the impression of engaging candour, and
would evoke—in me, certainly—the deepest
sympathy, especially if the interruption
were domestic. “Here I was compelled to
give orders for dinner.” “At this point a
man brought a bill with a cash discount on
first presentation—and never again after.”
“Just then Thisbe wished to know whether
or not she should send my love to Aunt
Sophia. I said <i>not</i>.” I could weep with
an author who put such things in. But
instead, for the sake of dignity and smoothness,
most of them try to ignore these
calamities, like painters who rub a little oil
into the edges of yesterday’s work; and go
on, stifling their emotions. There is probably
a great deal of simple heroism concealed
with care in the pages of even a third-class
novel.</p>

<p>“Are you writing something clever?”
asks Delia. What a demand she makes
upon one’s reticence! “Finish it quickly
and pick me some roses.” So I finished it
quickly, as you see. “I have passed this
way several times lately,” she explains, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
have always resisted the temptation of running
in. But this morning something drew
me down.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t been properly out before,”
I remark. There is no use, after all,
in being too obtuse. But I can’t go on juggling
with the present tense. Delia is gone
now. I shall treat her as a historical fact.</p>

<p>“I hope you remember what a lot you
used to send me last year,” she continued,
“and how grateful I always was.” I said I
remembered. “Yes,” she sighed. “You
set yourself a very good example,” and at
that I got up and sacrificed to her, with
gladness; because if Delia ever suffers cremation
the last whiff of her to float sadly
away will be her passion for a rose. There
are people who might dissolve in suggestion
before I would offer up a single petal, which
is deplorable in me, for if you want a thing
badly enough to hint for it, you must want it
very badly indeed. Nevertheless, I think it
a detestable habit, worse than punning; and
nothing rouses in me a spirit of fiercer, more
implacable opposition than a polite, gentle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
well-considered hint. Delia, of course,
doesn’t hint, she prods, and you accept her
elbow with delight, sharing the broad and
conscious humour of it.</p>

<p>I am glad Delia dropped in, I want to
talk about her; she holds to me so much
of the charm of this irresponsible impious
little Paradise that we have made for ourselves
up here above the clouds and connected
by wire with Westminster. A wire
is not a very substantial thing, and that, if
you leave out Mr. Kipling, is all that attaches
us to the rest of the world. If an ill-disposed
person, the Mullah Powindah or
another, should one day cut it, we might
float off anywhere, and be hardly more unrelated
to the planet we should lodge upon
than we are to our own. The founders of
Simla—may they dwell in beatitude for ever—saw
their golden chance and took it.
Far in and far up they climbed to build it,
and not being gods, but only men, they
thought well to leave the more obvious
forms of misery out of their survey plans.
They brought with them many desirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
things, not quite enough, but many; poverty
and sorrow and age they left at the bottom
of the hill. They barred out greed and ruin
by forbidding speculation; they warned off
the spectre of decrepitude by the “age limit”
which sends you after fifty-five to whiten
and perish elsewhere. This is an ordinance
that many call divine, for want of a better
word, but there ought to be a better word.
They made it so expensive that the widow
in her black takes the first ship to Balham,
and so attractive that the widower promptly
marries again. But they also arranged with
Death that he should seldom show himself
upon the Mall, so nobody has rue to wear,
even with a difference. From ten to five
we compose Blue Books, at least our husbands
do; the rest of the time we gallop
about on little country-bred ponies, and
vigorously dance, even to fifty-four years,
eleven months, and thirty days; and with
full hearts and empty heads—and this is the
consummation of bliss—congratulate ourselves.
There are houses where they play
games after dinner. I myself before I became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
the dryadess of a pencil-cedar, have
played games after dinner, and felt as innocent
and expansive as I did at nine.</p>

<p>Delia draws her breath in all this, and
opens a wicked Irish eye upon it—ah, what
Delia doesn’t see!—and is to me the gay
flower of it, delicately exhaling an essence
of Paris. I approve myself of just a suspicion
of essence of Paris. We are none
of us beasts of the field. I regret to say
that she misquotes. Her gloves fit perfectly,
and she carries herself like a lily of
the field, but she misquotes. It is the
single defect upon what she would be annoyed
to hear me call a lovely character.
I mention it because it is the only one. If
there were others, I should allow them to
be taken for granted, and protect myself
from the suspicion of exaggerated language.
That does not look like an absolutely serious
statement, but if I am writing nonsense it
is entirely the fault of Delia. She is packed
with nonsense like a siphon, and if you sit
much out-of-doors you become very absorbent.
She had been paying calls, and I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
obliged to restore her with vermouth and
a biscuit. She was bored and fatigued, and
she buried her nose in her roses and closed
her eyes expressively. “The ladies of
India,” she remarked, “are curiously alike.
Is it our mode of thought? Is it because
we have the same kind of husbands?”</p>

<p>“Some are much better than others,” I
interrupted.</p>

<p>“I saw eleven of us,” she went on with
depression, “one after the other, this morning.
I couldn’t help thinking of articles
on a counter marked ‘all this size five and
elevenpence-ha’penny.’”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Delia,” said I, “you are
not at all alike.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and nobody,” she hastened to apologize,
“could be less alike than <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“And yet we are quite different,” I replied;
and Delia, with a glance of reproach
and scorn and laughter said, “You
jackass!”</p>

<p>Now in anybody else’s mouth this term
would be almost opprobrious, but from
Delia’s it drops affectionately. It is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
acknowledgment, a compliment, it helps to
lighten the morning. It is not everybody
who could call one a jackass with impunity,
but it is not everybody who would think
of doing it. I should not wish the epithet
to become the fashion, but when Delia offers
it I roll it under my tongue.</p>

<p>“I am convinced,” said I, “that there
is nothing in the world so valuable as personality.
I mean, of course, to other people.
As you justly remark, Delia, we are round
pebbles on this coral strand, worn smooth
by rubbing against nothing but each other.
It is an obscure and little regarded form
of the great Imperial sacrifice, but I wish
somebody would call attention to it in the
<i>Daily Mail</i> and wring a tear from the British
public. You have still a slight unevenness
of surface, my Delia, and that is why
I love you. If you had a good sharp corner
or two, I should never let you out of my
sight.”</p>

<p>“And to think,” said Delia, finely, “how
little, in England, they prize and value their
precious angular old maids!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Oh, in England,” I replied, “I think
they are almost too much blessed. There is
such a thing as tranquillity and repose. You
don’t want the personal equation at every
meal. In England, especially in the academic
parts, you can’t see the wood for the trees.”</p>

<p>“And in America,” observed Delia, “I
suppose it must be worse.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I said out of my experience,
“in America there is as yet great uniformity
of peculiarity,” but this was going very far
afield on a warm day, and we left the matter
there.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I like individuality in
young men,” remarked Delia, thoughtfully,
“In young men it seems a liberty, almost
an impertinence.”</p>

<p>I can imagine the normal attitude of
young men toward Delia being quite satisfying,
but I let her go on.</p>

<p>“I have just met an A.D.C. riding up
the Mall smoking a pipe,” she continued.
“He took off his hat to me like a bandit.”
Now Simla’s traditions of behaviour are
very strict and the choicest of them are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
locked up in the <i>tenue</i> of an aide-de-camp.
“It was quite a shock,” said Delia.</p>

<p>“All things are possible in nature, but
some are rare,” I told her. “It is doubtless
a remote effect of all this Irregular
Horse in South Africa. You may live to
boast that you have seen an aide-de-camp
ride up the Mall at Simla smoking a common
clay.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a common clay,” she corrected
me.</p>

<p>“But it will be when you boast of it,” I
assured her. “Come and see my home
for decayed gentlewomen.”</p>

<p>“What <i>do</i> you mean?” she cried, and
would have buffeted me; but I led her with
circumstance to the edge of the shelf, over
which appeared lower down on the khud-side,
another small projection which tried to
be a shelf and couldn’t, but was still flat
enough for purposes. There were sitting,
in respectable retirement, all the venerable
roses that had outlived delight, the common
kinds and those that had grown little worth
in the service of the summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“They had to come out,” I explained,
“and I couldn’t find it in my heart to
throw them on the ash-heap.”</p>

<p>“With all their modest roots exposed,”
put in Delia. “Cruel it would have
been.”</p>

<p>“So I planted them down there, and I
see that they’re not altogether neglected.
They get an allowance of four buckets of
water a day and a weeding once a fortnight,”
I explained further, “but what I fancy they
must feel most is that nobody ever picks
them. I can’t get down to do that.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure they look most comfortable,”
Delia assured me. “What do they care
about being picked? You lose that vanity
very early”—oh, Delia!—“What they
really enjoy is to sit in the sun and talk
about their gout. But I know what you
mean about throwing away a flower”—and
Delia’s eyes grew more charming with the
sentiment behind them. “Somebody gave
me a sweet-pea yesterday and the poor little
thing faded on me, as we say in Ireland, and
of course I ought to have thrown it away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
but I couldn’t. What do you think I did
with it?” She looked half ashamed.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“<i>I put it in my pocket!</i>” said this dear
Delia.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter IX</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; AM not getting on at all; it is days
since Delia was here and I wrote
about her. There is certainly this
advantage in the walls of a house,
they make a fold for your mind, which must
browse inside, picking up what it can. But
existence in a garden was not meant to be
interfered with by a pen; we have the best
reason for believing that Adam never wrote
for publication, much less Eve, who of
course, when one thinks of it, was absorbed
at that time in the first principles of dress-making.
I envy her that original seam;
sewing is an ideal occupation in a garden.
You can be for ever looking up and the hand
goes on of itself; everything rhymes with
your needle, and your mind seems stimulated
by its perfunctory superintendence to spin
and weave other things, often lovely and
interesting things which it is a pain to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
forgotten by dinner-time. I should very
much prefer fine stitching to composition
out here if I could choose. One might then
look at the sun on the leaves without the
itch and necessity to explain just what it is
like. Moreover, there is always this worry:
you cannot make a whole chapter out of the
sun on the leaves, even at different angles,
and yet before that happy circumstance what
else is there to say? But how little use
there is in crying for what one was not
meant to have. The fairy godmother who
put this unwilling instrument into my hand
and denied me a needle will have something
to answer for if ever I meet her. Meanwhile
I might as well confess that my finest
stitching only makes mirth for Thisbe, and
“lay a violence,” as Stevenson advises, upon
my will to other ends.</p>

<p>It is the very height of the season in the
garden. The roses have held several drawing-rooms
and practically everybody is here.
Sweet-peas flutter up two of the verandah
pillars, the rest are dark with honeysuckle
and heavy with Maréchal Niels. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
pansies are thicker than ever, and a very
elegant double wisteria, a lady from Japan,
trails her purple skirts over the trellis under
which the rickshaws go to their abode. The
corn-bottles have come up exactly where I
asked them to, scattered thick among the
leaves of the chrysanthemums which are
already tall and bushy. They are exactly
the right blue in exactly the right green and
they give a little air, not at all a disagreeable
little air, of discernment and sophistication
to their corner of the garden. I would like
to venture to say that they resemble blue
stars in a green sky, if I were sure of offending
nobody’s sense of humour. It is natural
enough to observe this and pass on, but
why should one find a subtle pleasure in the
comparison, and linger over it? It must be
the same throb of joyful activity with which
the evolved human intelligence first detected
a likeness between any two of the phenomena
about it, and triumphed in the perception,
attracted to wisdom and stirred to
art. Those indeed were days to live in,
when everything was mysteriously to copy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and inherit and nothing was exploited, explained,
laid bare, when the great sweet
thoughts were all to think and heroism had
not yet received its molecular analysis, and
babies equipped with an instinctive perception
of the fundamental weakness of socialistic
communism were neither born nor
thought of. These seem violent reflections
to make in a garden, and they may well be
obscured behind the long bed of poppies
and field-daisies and more bluets that runs
along the side of the house under the windows
that support the roses. If you can
tell me for what primitive reason poppies
and field-daisies and corn-flowers go well
together I had rather you didn’t.</p>

<p>I have clumps and clumps of hollyhocks,
and a balustrade of them, pink and white
ones, on each side of the steps that run
down from the verandah in front of the
drawing-room door. It is an unsophisticated
thing, the single hollyhock, like a
bashful school child in a sun-bonnet. Do
what you will you cannot make it feel at
home among the beaux and belles of high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
life in the garden; it never looks really
happy except just inside a cottage paling
with a bunch of rhubarb on one side and a
tangle of “old man” on the other. Still it
is a good and grateful flower in whatever
station it pleases the sun to call it. It gets
along on the merest necessities of life when
times are bad and water scarce, and flowers,
with anything like a chance, twice in the season.
One cannot, after all, encourage class
feeling in the garden; there every one must
stand on his own roots, and take his share
of salts and carbon dioxide without precedence,
and the hollyhocks in my garden receive
as much consideration as anybody.</p>

<p>Petunias are up all over the place, purple
and white and striped. I knew by experience
that we could have too many petunias
on this shelf, so whenever a vague, young
pushing thing disclosed itself to be a petunia,
as it nearly always did, I requested Atma to
pull it up. Nevertheless they survive surprisingly
everywhere, looking out among the
feet of the roses, flaunting over the forget-me-nots,
unexpected in a box of seedling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
asters. Now if I were going to recognize
social distinctions in the garden, which I am
not, I should call the good petunia a person
unmistakably middle-class. Whether it is this
incapacity of hers to see a snub, or her very
full skirt, or her very high colour, the petunia
always seems to me a bourgeoise little lady
in her Sunday best, with her hair smooth and
her temper well kept under for the occasion.
I think she leads her family a nagging life,
and goes to church regularly. One should
always mass them; a single petunia here and
there among the community of flowers is
more desolate and ineffective than most
maiden ladies. Rather late this spring we
discovered a corner of the bed in front of
the dining-room window to be quite empty,
and what to put in we couldn’t think, and
were considering, when Atma told us that
he knew of a thousand petunias homeless
and roaming the shelf. I quite believed
him, and bade him gather them in, with such
a resultant blaze of purple as I shall never
in future be without. The border just
beyond them is simply shouting with yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
coreopsis, and behind that rise the dark
branches of the firs on the khud-side, and
between these, very often in broken pictures
sharp against the blue, the jagged points
and peaks of the far snows. All this every
morning the person has with her eggs and
bacon who sits opposite the dining-room
window. I am glad to say that the other
members of my family object to the glare.</p>

<p>Atma has a liberal and progressive mind
toward the garden; he is always trying to
smuggle some new thing into it. In out-of-the-way
corners I constantly come upon
perfect strangers, well-rooted and entirely at
home, and when I ask him by whose order
they were admitted, he smiles apologetically
and says that without doubt they will be
very beautiful, and that his brother gave
them to him. He can never tell me the
name. “It will be so high,” he shows me
with his hand, stooping, “and the flower
will be red, simply red it will arrive.” I
look at it without enthusiasm, and weakly
let it stay. Generally it “arrives” a common
little disappointment, but once a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
leggy thing turned out an evening primrose,
and I knew, before it was too late, that I had
been entertaining an angel unawares.</p>

<p>“To grow a little catholic,” writes Stevenson,
“is the compensation of years.” Dear
shade, is it so? In the spiritual outlook,
perhaps, in the moral retrospect,—but in
matters of taste, in likes and dislikes? You
who wrote nothing lightly must have proved
this dispensation, poorer spirits can only
wish it more general. I remember youth
as curious and enterprising, hospitable to
everything, and I begin to find the middle
years jealously content with what they have.
Who, when he has reached the age of all
the world, looks with instinctive favour upon
anything new? An acquaintance, who may
create the common debt of friendship; you
are long since heavily involved. An author,
who may insist upon intimately engaging
your intelligence,—a thing you feel, after a
time, to be a liberty in a new-comer. Or
even a flower, offering another sentiment to
the little store that holds some pain already.
Now this godetia. I suppose it argues a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
depth of ignorance, but until Mr. Johnson
recommended it to me in the spring, I had
never heard of godetia. Mr. Johnson is
the source of seeds and bulbs for Simla, we
all go to him; but I, for one, always come
away a little ruffled by his habit of referring
to everything by its Latin name, and plainly
showing that his respect for you depends
upon your understanding him. I have
wished to preserve Mr. Johnson’s respect,
and things have come up afterward that I
did not think I had ordered. However,
this is by the way. Mr. Johnson assured
me that godetia had a fine fleshy flower
of variegated colours, would be an abundant
bloomer, and with reasonable care should
make a good appearance. I planted it with
misgivings, and watched its advent with
aloofness, I knew I shouldn’t recognize it,
and I didn’t. I had never seen it before, I
very nearly said so; and at my time of life,
with so many old claims pressing, I could
not attempt a new affection. And I have
taken the present opportunity, when Atma’s
back is turned, and pulled it all up. Besides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
it may have been fleshy, but it wasn’t pretty,
and the slugs ate it till its appearance was
disgraceful.</p>

<p>I suppose our love of flowers is impregnated
with our love of life and our
immense appreciation of each other. We
hand our characteristics up to God to figure
in; we look for them in animals with delight
and laughter, and it is even our pleasure to
find them out here in the garden. Who
cares much for lupins, for example; they
are dull fellows, they have no faces; yet
who does not care for every flower with a
heart and eyes, that gives back your glance
to you and holds up its head bravely to any
day’s luck, as you would like to do.</p>

<p>But it is growing late. I can still see a
splendid crimson cactus glooming at me from
his tub in the verandah; the rest of the
garden has drawn away into the twilight.
Only the honeysuckle, that nobody notices
when the sun is bright and the flowers all
talk at once, sends out a timid sweetness to
the night and murmurs, “I am here.” If I
might have had a seam to do, it would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
been finished; but instead there has been this
vexatious chapter, which only announces,
when all is said and done, that another
human being has spent a day in the garden.
I intended to write about the applied
affections.</p>

<p>But it is too late even for the misapplied
affections, generally thought, I believe,
the more interesting presentment. Happy
Thisbe on the verandah, conscious of another
bud to her tapestry, glances at the
fading west and makes ready to put all
away. I will lay down my pen, as she does
her needle, and gather up my sheets and
scraps, as she does her silks and wools; and
humbly, if I can get no one else to do it for
me, carry my poor pattern into the house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter X</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Princess has a hill almost
entirely to herself. She lives
there in a castle almost entirely
made of stone, with turrets and
battlements. Her affectionate subjects cluster
about her feet in domiciles walled with
mud and principally roofed with kerosene
tins, but they cheerfully acknowledge this to
be right and proper, and all they can pay
for. One of the many advantages of being
a princess is that you never have to put
down anything for house-rent; there is always
a castle waiting for you and a tax-payer
happy to paper it. The world will not
allow that it is responsible to a beggar for
a crust; but it is delighted to admit that it
owes every princess a castle. It is a curious
world; but it is quite right, for princesses
are to be encouraged and beggars aren’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>The Princess is married to the Roy-Regent,
who puts his initial upon Resolutions
and writes every week to the Secretary
of State; but it is the Princess who is
generally “at home,” and certainly the
Princess who matters. The Roy-Regent
may induce his Government to make Resolutions;
the Princess could persuade it, I
am sure, to break them—if she wanted to.
Unfortunately we are not permitted to see
that comedy, which would be adorable. She
does not want to. She is not what you
would call a political princess; I have no
doubt she has too much else to do. To begin
with, only to begin with, she has to go on being
beautiful and kind and unruffled; she has to
keep the laughter in her eyes and the gentleness
in her heart; she has to be witty without
being cynical, and initiated without being
hard. She has to see through all our little
dodges to win her favour and not entirely
despise us, and to accept our rather dull and
very daily homage without getting sick and
tired of us. To say nothing of the Roy-Regent
and the babies who have some claims,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
I suppose, though we are apt to talk about
the Princess as if she were here solely to
hold her Majesty’s vice-Drawing-rooms and
live up to a public ideal. All the virtues, in
short, which the rest of us put on of a
Sunday, the Princess must wear every day;
and that is why it is so difficult and often so
tiresome to be a real princess.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Simla Princess is not
expected to hold her commission for life.
Her Majesty knew, I suppose, from her
own royal experience, how it got on the
nerves, and realized that if she required anything
like that it would be impossible to get
the right kind of people. So at the end of
every four or five years the Roy-Regent
goes home to his ordinary place in the Red
Book burdened for life with a frontier policy,
but never again compelled to drive out in
the evenings attended by four cantering
Sikhs, each Sikh much larger than himself
and shaking a lance. He may go on to
greater things, or he may simply return to
the family estates; but in any case the Princess
can put her crown away in a drawer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
do things, if she likes, in the kitchen, which
must be a great relief. Of course she can
never quite forget that she has been a princess,
in commission, once. The thought
must have an ennobling effect ever after, and
often interpose, as it were, between the word
and the blow in domestic differences. For
this reason alone, many of us would gladly
undertake to find the necessary fortitude for
the task; but it is not a thing you can get
by merely applying for it.</p>

<p>To the state of the Princess belongs that
quaint old-fashioned demonstration, the
curtsey. The Princess curtseys to the
Queen-Empress—how I should like to
see her do it!—and we all curtsey to
the Princess. This alone would make
Simla a school for manners, now that you
have to travel so far, unless you are by way
of running in and out of Windsor Castle, to
find the charming form in ordinary use.
How admirable a point of personal contact
lies in the curtsey—what deference rendered,
what dignity due! “You are a
Princess,” it says, “therefore I bend my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
knee. I am a Person, therefore I straighten
it again,” and many things more graceful,
more agreeable, more impertinent than that.
Indeed, there is a very little that cannot be
said in the lines and the sweep of a curtsey.
To think there was a time when conversation
was an art, and curtseying an accomplishment,
is to hate our day of monosyllables
and short cuts, of sentiments condensed, and
opinions taken for granted. One wonders
how we came to lose the curtsey, and how
much more went with it, how we could ever
let it go, to stand instead squarely on our
two feet and nod our uncompromising heads,
and say what we have to say. I suppose it
is one of the things that are quite gone; we
can never reaffect it, indeed our behaviour,
considered <i>as</i> behaviour, is growing steadily
worse. Already you may be asked, by a
person whom you have never seen before,
whether you prefer Ecclesiastics or Omar
Khayyám, or how you would define the ego,
or what you think of Mr. Le Gallienne—matters
which require confidence, almost a
curtain. We have lost the art of the gradual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
approach; presently we shall hustle each
other like kinetic atoms. A kinetic atom, I
understand, goes straight to the point.</p>

<p>We all love curtseying to the Princess
therefore, partly because it is a lost art, and
partly because it is a way in which we can
say, without being fulsome or troublesome,
how happy we are to see her. There is
only one circumstance under which it is not
entirely a privilege. That is when, dismounted,
one meets her in one’s habit.
Whether it is the long boots or the short
skirt, or the uncompromising cut, I cannot
say, but I always feel, performing a curtsey
to the Princess in my habit, that I am in a
false position. Every true woman loves to
stalk about in her habit, and tap her heels
with her riding crop; there is a shadow of
the privileges of the other sex about it which
is alluring, and which, as the costume is sanctioned,
one can enjoy comfortably; but it is
not arranged for curtseying, and there ought
to be a dispensation permitting ladies wearing
it to bow from the waist.</p>

<p>Then the Princess passes on, leaving you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
smiling. I have seen people continue to
smile in a lower key for twenty minutes after
the Princess has gone by, as water will go
on reflecting a glow long after the sunlight
has left it. The effect is quite involuntary,
and of course it looks a little foolish, but it
is agreeable to feel, and nobody, positively
nobody, can produce it but the Princess.
Indeed the power to produce it would be a
capital test for princesses.</p>

<p>If I were in any way in a position to submit
princesses to tests, I should offer that of
the single pea and the twenty feather beds
with confidence to ours. Which is a pride
and a pleasure to be able to say in these days,
when ladies thus entitled are so apt to disguise
themselves in strong minds or blunt
noses or irritating clothes. It is delightful
to be assured that, in spite of this tendency,
the Princess has not yet vanished, the Princess
of the fairy tales, the real Princess, from
among us, that such a one is sitting at the
moment in her castle, not ten minutes’ walk
from here, eating marmalade with a golden
spoon, or whatever she likes better than marmalade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and bringing to life day after day
that delight in living which you must have,
or there’s no use in being a princess. It is
possible that she may not put on her diadem
every morning; there is no necessity for
that, since you could not imagine her without
it; and if she prefers reading her Browning
to watching her gold-fish, it is not in any
way my affair. Indeed, although she occupies
a public position, there is no one who
more readily accedes her right to a private
life than I, though, of course, with the rest
of her subjects, I would prefer that she had
as little of it as possible. It is said that the
Roy-Regent, knowing what would be expected
of her, was not content until he had
found the most beautiful and agreeable Princess
there was; and I can well believe that
he sailed over seas and seas to find her,
though it is probably only a tradition that
they met at George Washington’s country
seat where the Princess was looking for trailing
arbutus,—another lovely thing whose
habitat is the banks of the Potomac. And an
improbable tradition, as George Washington
never encouraged princesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Last night there was an entertainment at
the castle and among the guests a chief of
one of those smaller Indias that cluster about
the great one. He wore his own splendid
trappings, and he was a handsome fellow,
well set up; and above his keen dark face,
in front of the turban, set round with big
irregular pearls, was fastened a miniature of
the Queen-Empress who holds his fealty in
her hand. To him the Princess, all in filmy
lace with her diadem flashing, spoke kindly.
They sat upon gold-backed chairs a little way
apart, and as she leaned to confer her smile
and he to receive it, I longed to frame the picture
and make perpetual the dramatic moment,
the exquisite odd chance. “Surely,”
thought I, “the world has never been so graciously
bridged before.” Talking of George
Washington, if the good man could have
seen that, I think he might have melted toward
princesses; I do not think, from all
we know of him, that he would have had
the heart to turn coldly away and disclaim
responsibility for this one. I wish he could
have seen it; yes, and Martha too, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
if anybody thought necessary to make trouble
and talk about sacred principles of democracy,
it would have been Martha. Martha, she
would have been the one. Her great and
susceptible husband would have taken a
philosophic pinch of snuff and toasted
posterity.</p>

<p>I see that I have already admitted it, I
have slipped in the path of virtuous resolution
and lofty indifference; I have gone
back, just for a minute, into the world. The
reason I have neglected every flower in the
garden this morning to write about the Princess
is that I have been dining with her. It
is so difficult to be unmoved and firm when
you know the band will play and there will
be silver soup-plates, to say nothing of the
Roy-Regent smiling and pleased to see you,
and the Roman punch in the middle of the
menu. At home, one so seldom has Roman
punch in the middle of the menu. Besides,
now that I think of it, it was a “command”
invitation, and I did not go for any of these
reasons, or even to see the Princess, but because
I had to; a lofty compulsion of State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
was upon me, and nobody would place her
loyalty in question on account of a possible
draught. If there had been a draught and
I had taken cold I should have felt an added
nobility to-day; somewhat the virtue, I suppose,
of the elderly statesman who contracts
a fatal influenza at a distinguished interment,
and so creates a vicious circle of funerals;
but there was no draught.</p>

<p>The Princess lives in splendid isolation.
If it were not for the Roy-Regent and the
babies, and the Commander-in-Chief and
<i>his</i> family, she would die of loneliness. And
of course the Bishop, though I can’t understand
in what way one would depend much
upon a bishop, except to ask a blessing
when he came to dinner. Kind and human
as the Princess is she lives in another world,
with an A.D.C. always going in front to
tell people to get up, “Their Excellencies
are coming.” You cannot ask after the
Princess’s babies as you would ask after the
babies of a person like yourself; you
must say, “How are Your Excellency’s
babies?” and this at once removes them far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
beyond the operation of your affectionate
criticism. When it is impossible even to
take babies for granted the difficulties of the
situation may be imagined. The situation
is glorious but troubling, your ideas often
will not flow freely in it, and is there anything
more dreadful at a supreme moment
than to have your ideas stick? You find
yourself saying the same thing you said the
last time you had the honour, which is the
most mortifying thing that can happen in
any conversation.</p>

<p>I often wonder whether the Princess does
not look at our little mud houses and wish
sometimes that she could come in. The
thought is a reckless one but I do entertain
it. If you take a kind and friendly interest
in people as the Princess does in us all, you
cannot be entirely satisfied merely to add
them up as population and set them a good
example. Nor can it be very interesting to
look at the little mud houses and observe
only that they have chimneys, and not to
know how the mantelpieces are done or
whether there is a piano, or if anybody else’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
sweet-peas are earlier than yours. In my
dreams I sometimes invite the Princess to
tea. An A.D.C. always comes behind her
carrying the diadem on a red silk cushion,
but at my earnest prayer he is made to
stay outside on the verandah. We have
the best china; and in one dream the Princess
broke a cup and we wept together.
On another occasion she gave me a recipe
for pickled blackberries and told me of a
way—I always forget the way—of getting
rid of frowns. There is generally something
to spoil a dream, and the thing that
spoils this one is the A.D.C., who will look
in at the window. All the same we have a
lovely time, the Princess ignoring all her
prerogatives, unless I say something about
the state of the country, when she instantly,
royally, changes the subject....</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XI</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF you choose to live on the top of one
of the Himalayas there are some
things you must particularly pay for.
One of them is earth. Your mountain,
if it is to be depended upon, is mostly
made of rock and I have already mentioned
how radically it slopes. So a garden is not
at all a thing to be taken for granted. Sometimes
you have a garden and sometimes only
a shaly ledge, or you may have a garden to-day
which to-morrow has slid down the hill
and superimposed itself upon your neighbour
below. That occurs in the rains; it
is called a “slip.” It has never been our
experience because the shelf is fairly flat;
but it has happened to plenty of people.
I suppose such a garden is recoverable, if
you are willing to take the trouble, but it
could never be quite the same thing. The
most permanent plot, however, requires all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
kinds of attention, and one of the difficulties
is to keep it up to its own level. Queer
sinkings and fallings away are always taking
place in the borders. Atma professes to
find them quite reasonable; he says the
flowers eat the earth and of course it disappears.
The more scientific explanation
appears to me to be that the gnomes of the
mountain who live inside, have been effecting
repairs, and naturally the top falls in.
It may be said that gnomes are not as a rule
so provident; but very little has yet been
established about the Himalayan kind; they
might be anything; they probably are.</p>

<p>This whole morning Atma and I have
been patching the garden. At home when
you buy a piece of land you expect that
enough earth will go with it for ordinary
purposes, but here you buy the land first
and the earth afterwards, as you want it, in
basketfuls. There is plenty in the jungle,
beautiful leaf-mould, but it is against the
law to collect it there for various reasons, all
of them excellent and tiresome; you must
buy it instead from the Town Council, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
it costs fourpence a basket. Tiglath-Pileser
says it is the smallest investment in land he
ever heard of, but it takes a great many
baskets, and when the bill comes in I shall
be glad to know if he is still of that opinion.
Meanwhile coolie after coolie dumps his
load and I have heard of no process that
more literally improves the property. You
will imagine whether, when anything is
pulled up, we do not shake the roots.</p>

<p>How far a sharp contrast will carry the
mind! I never shake a root in these our
limited conditions without thinking of the
long loamy stretches of the Canadian woods
where there was leaf-mould enough for a
continent of gardens, and of the plank
“sidewalk” that half-heartedly wandered
out to them from the centre of what was a
country town in my day, adorned perhaps
at some remote and unfenced corner by a
small grocery shop where hickory nuts in a
half-pint measure were exposed for sale in
the window. I am no longer passionately
addicted to hickory nuts—you got the
meat out with infinite difficulty and a pin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
and if it was obstinate you sucked it—but
nothing else, except perhaps the smell in the
cars of the train-boy’s oranges, will ever
typify to me so completely the liberal and
stimulating opportunities of a new country.
The town when I was there last had grown
into a prosperous city, and there were no
hickory nuts in its principal stores, but at
the furthest point of a suburban sidewalk
I found the little grocery still tempting the
school children of the neighbourhood with
this unsophisticated product and the half-pint
measure in the window. I resisted the
temptation to buy any, but I stood and looked
so long that the proprietress came curious to
the door. And along that sidewalk you
might have taken a ton of leaf-mould before
anybody made it his business to stop you.</p>

<p>We must acknowledge our compensations.
Over there they certainly get their
leaf-mould cheaper than fourpence a basket,
but they have nobody to make things grow
in it under a dollar a day. Here Atma, the
invaluable Atma, labours for ten rupees a
month—about fourteen shillings—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
cooks his own meal cakes. The man who
works for a dollar a day does it in the earnest
hope, if we are to believe his later biographer,
of a place in ward politics and the
easier situation of a local boss. It would be
hard to infect Atma with such vulgar ambitions.
He is so lately from the hands of
his Creator that he has not even yet conceived
the idea of accumulation. The other
day I told him that he might take a quantity
of seed and surplus plants, and sell
them, and he would not. “I, how shall I
sell?” he said, “I am a gardener. This
thing is done by Johnson-sahib,” and he
looked at me with amusement. I called
him by a foolish name and told him that he
should surely sell, and get money; but he
shook his head still smiling. “By your
honour’s favour,” he said, “month by month
I find ten rupees. From this there is food
twice a day and clothes, and two or three
rupees to go by the hand of an old man
who comes from my people. It is enough.
What more?” I mentioned the future.
“Old?” he cried, “God knows if I will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
old. At this time I am a work-doing
wallah. When I am old and your honours
are gone to <i>Belaat</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I also will go, and live
with my people.”</p>

<p>“And they will, without doubt, give you
food and clothes?” I asked.</p>

<p>“According as there is,” he said, “without
doubt they will give it,” and went on with
his work.</p>

<p>Here, if you like, was a person of short
views and unvexed philosophy. A lecture
upon the importance of copper coins trembled
on my lips, but I held it back. A base
aim is a poor exchange for a lesson in content,
and I held it back, wondering whether
my servant might not be better off than I,
in all that he could do without.</p>

<p>Alas for the poor people who have to pay
at the rate of a dollar a day and mind their
own business into the bargain! Never can
they know one of the greatest pleasures of
life, to be served by a serving people. There
is a spark of patriarchal joy, long extinct
west of Suez, in the simple old interpretation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
which still holds here, of the relation of master
and servant, scolding and praise, favour
and wrath; a lifelong wage and occasionally
a little medicine are still the portion of the
servant-folk, accepted as a matter of course,
and “Thou wilt not hear orders?” ever a
serious reproach. To all of us Outlanders
of the East, it is one of the consolations of
exile, and to some of us a keen and constant
pleasure to be the centre and source of prosperity
for these others, a simple, graphic,
pressing opportunity to do justice and love
mercy and walk humbly with their God. I,
personally, like them for themselves—who
could help liking Atma?—and of persons
to whom they do not at all appeal I have
my own opinion. It is the difference of
race, no doubt, which makes this relation
possible and enjoyable, the difference, and
what we are accustomed to consider the
superiority, of ours. At home all generous
minds are somewhat tormented by a sense
of the unfairness of the menial brand, and
in the attitude of the menial mind there is
nothing to modify that impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Servants in this place are regarded as
luxuries, and taxed. So much you pay per
capita, and whether the capita belongs to a
body entirely in your employment, or to one
which only serves you in common with
several other people, it doesn’t matter; all
the same you pay. Delia and I share a
dhurjee, or sewing man, for example, and we
are both chargeable for him. This I never
could reconcile with my sense of justice and
of arithmetic,—that the poll-tax of a whole
man should be paid on half a tailor; but
there is no satisfaction to be got out of
Tiglath-Pileser. Some people have more
respect for the law than it really deserves.
I had the pleasure, however, of bringing him
to a sense of his responsibilities when the
tax-paper came in, from which he learned
that no less than fifteen heads of families
looked to him to be their providence.
Under the weight of this communication he
turned quite pale, and sat down hastily upon
the nearest self-sustaining object, which
happened to be the fender. But as a matter
of fact he liked the idea. Every Englishman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
does, and this is why a certain measure of
success attends not only his domestic but
his general experiments in governing the
East. He loves the service of an idea, and
nothing flatters him so truly as his conception
of all that he has to do.</p>

<p>The ear sharpens if its owner lives in the
garden. It is no longer muffled by the four
walls of a house, and remote sounds visit it,
bringing with them a meaning which somehow
they never have indoors, even when
they penetrate there. Up here they principally
make one aware of the silence, which
is such a valuable function of sounds. I
should like to write a chapter about the quiet
of Simla, but of course if one began like that
one would never finish. It is our vast
solace, our great advantage; we live without
noise. The great ranges forbid it; the only
thing they will listen to is a salute from the
big gun, and they pass that from one to
another, uncertain that is not an insult. And
the quenching comment in the silence that
follows!</p>

<p>It is tremendous, invincible, taken up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
rewritten in the lines of all the hills. It
stands always before our little colony, with a
solemn finger up, so that a cheer from the
cricket ground is a pathetic thing, and the
sound of the Roy-Regent’s carriage wheels
awakens memories of Piccadilly. We are
far withdrawn and very high up, fifty-six
miles down to the level, and then it is only
empty India—and the stillness lies upon us
and about us and up and down the khuds,
almost palpable and so morne, but with the
sweetest melancholy. Consider, you of
London and New York, what it must be to
live on one mountain-side and hear a crow
caw across the valley, on the other. Of
course we are a Secretariat people; we have
no factory whistles.</p>

<p>This afternoon, however, I hear an unlicensed
sound. It is the sound of an infant
giving tongue, and it comes from the quarters.
Now there ought not to be a baby in
the quarters; it is against all orders. No
form of domestic ménage is permitted there;
the place is supposed to be a monastery, and
the servants to house their women-folk elsewhere.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
The sound is as persistent as it is
unwarrantable; it is not only a breach of
custom, but displeasing. How am I to
reckon with it? I may send for Dumboo
and complain. In that case the noise will
cease at once; they will give opium to the
child, which will injure its digestion, and in
the future, as a grown-up person, it will enjoy
life less because I could not put up with its
crying as an infant. I can report the matter
to Tiglath-Pileser, which would mean an end
to the baby, not illegally, by banishment.
But is it so easy? One approves, of course,
of all measures to discourage them about the
premises, but when in spite of rules and
regulations a baby has found its way in, and
is already lamenting its worldly prospects at
the top of its voice, in honest confidence
that at least the roof over its head will be
permanent, a complication arises. I cannot
dislodge such a one. Better deafness and
complicity.</p>

<p>Far down the khud-side an Imperial
bugle. Abroad the spaces the mountains
stand in, and purple valleys deepening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Among the deodars a whisper, not of scandal,
believe me. A mere announcement
that the day is done. On the other side of
the hill a pony trotting, farther and fainter
receding, but at the farthest and faintest it
is plain that he goes short in front. From
the bazaar a temple bell, with the tongue of
an alien religion....</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TO-DAY I think India, down below
there on the other side of
the hill, must be at its hottest.
A white dust haze hangs over
the plains, but we know what is going on
under it; nearly all of us have gasped
through June more than once in those regions.
It is the time when you take medical
advice before committing yourself to a railway
journey, even with the provision of a
cracked-ice pillow,—the favourite time to
step out of the train and die of cholera in the
waiting room. It is also the very special
time for the British private soldier to go
out in anger and kick with his foot the punkah-wallah
who has fallen asleep with the
slack rope in his hand, so that the punkah-wallah,
in whom is concealed unknown to
the private soldier an enlarged spleen, immediately
dies. There is then trouble and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
high-talking, because of the people who consider
that the death of a punkah-wallah demands
the life of a private soldier who only
meant to admonish him, a contention which
cannot be judged without a knowledge of
the relative values concerned, and an experience
of the temperature in which the rash
and negligent act was committed. There is
reason in the superstition which associates
great heat with the devil. Operating alone,
it can do almost as much as he can.</p>

<p>The dust haze from the plains hangs all
about us, obscuring even the near ranges,
impalpable but curiously solid. It has a
flavour which it is impossible not to taste if
ever one breathes through the mouth, and
hour by hour it silently gathers upon the
furniture. It has been like this for a week,
pressing round us at a measured distance,
which just enables us to see our own houses
and gardens. Within that space, the sunlight
and every circumstance as usual. It is
a little like living under a ground-glass bell.
Do not choose the present time of year to
come to see Simla. You would have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
make a house-to-house visitation, and piece
it together from memory.</p>

<p>Even here, in the garden, much too hot
the eye of heaven shines. I have abandoned
the pencil-cedar, and taken refuge under a
trellis covered with a banksia rose, which is
thicker, and I have added to my defences a
pith hat and an umbrella. Notwithstanding
these precautions, we all gasp together to-day
in the garden; and I am inclined to agree
with the mignonette, which is not as a rule
talkative, that this is no longer the summer—exquisite
word—that we expect in Simla,
but the odious “hot weather” which comes
instead in the country down below. The
mignonette, by the way, stands to my discernment,
immediately under the pencil-cedar.
When I sowed it there in the spring,
Tiglath-Pileser said, “It will never do anything
under a conifer.” When it began to
show, he said again, “It may come up, but
it will never do anything. Nothing ever
does anything under a conifer.” Atma was
not of this advice. “Come up?” he said,
looking at it sternly, “wherefore should it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
not come up, if your honour wishes it?”
Atma always takes this view; he seems to
suppose that the flowers, like himself, are
above all things anxious to please, and if
any of them fail in their duty, he implies,
with indignation, that he will know the
reason why. But his opinion is too constant,
and I did not trust it about the
mignonette. I insisted, instead, that every
morning the fallen cedar spines should be
picked out of it, and the earth freshly stirred
about the roots; and I have a better patch
of mignonette under my conifer than can be
produced anywhere else in the garden. I
am sure that the shade of a conifer is no less
beneficial than any other kind of shade, except
that there is never enough of it; nor
can I accept the theory that there is anything
poisonous in the spines. They only
pack and only lie very closely together,
never blown about like leaves, and so keep
away the air and light, and if you happen to
have the use of twenty or thirty brown
fingers to pick them out, there is no reason
why you cannot produce quantities of things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
beside mignonette under a conifer. Do anything?
I do not know a more able-bodied
or hard-working flower on the shelf.</p>

<p>A thing like that offers one for some time
afterwards a valuable handle in arguments.</p>

<p>However you do it, there is no more delicious
experience in life than to put something
beautiful where nothing was before, I
mean in any suitable empty space. I have
done it; I have had the consummation of
this pleasure for a fortnight. There was no
goldenrod in Simla till I went to America
and got it. I make the lofty statement with
confidence, but subject to correction. Some
one may have thought of it long ago, and
may be able to confront me with finer plumes
than mine. If this should be so, I shall
accept it with reluctance and mortification,
and hereby promise to go and admire the
other person’s, which is the most anybody
can do; but my pride does not expect such
a fall.</p>

<p>It is the Queen’s goldenrod, not the
President’s, though he has a great deal of
it and makes, I think, rather more fuss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
about it. A field flower of generous mind,
it ignores the political line, and I gathered
the seed one splendid autumn afternoon in
Canada; so here on the shelf it may claim
its humble part in the Imperial idea. A
friend of my youth lent herself to the project;
she took me in her father’s buggy,
and as we went along the country roads I
saw again in the light of a long absence, the
quiet of the fields and the broad pebbled
stretches of the river, and the bronze and
purple of the untrimmed woods that had
always been for me the margin of the
thought of home. The quiet of after-harvest
held it all, nothing was about but a
chipmunk that ran along the top of a fence;
you could count the apples in the orchards
among their scanty leaves; it was time to
talk and to remember. And so, not by
anything unusual that we did or said, but
by the rare and beautiful correspondence
that is sometimes to be felt between the
sentiment of the hour and the hour itself,
this afternoon took its place in the dateless
calendar of the heart which is so much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
valuable a reference than any other. What
a delight it is when old forgotten things
construct themselves again and the years
gather into an afternoon! And is there
any such curious instance of real usefulness
for hidden treasure in the attic?</p>

<p>We found masses of goldenrod, all dry
and scattering, principally along the railway
embankment, which we took for a good
omen that it would be a travelling flower;
and in the fulness of time it was given to
Atma with instructions. His excitement
was even greater than mine, he nursed it
tenderly, but it needed no nursing. It
came up in thousands delighted with itself
and the new climate, overrunning its boxes
so that Atma pointed to it like a proud
father. Then we planted it out along the
paling behind the coreopsis, and it immediately—that
is to say in three months’ time—grew
to be five feet high, with the most
thick and lovely yellow sprays, which have
been waving there against the fir-trees, as
I said before, for the last fortnight. It has
quite lost the way to its proper season; at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
home it blossoms in September and this is
only June,—but it appears to be rather
the better than the worse for that, though
it does seem to look about, as the Princess
said when I sent her some, for the red sumach
which is its friend and companion at home.
It is itself like a little fir-tree with flat
spreading branches of blossom, especially
when it stands in groups as they do, and
the sun slants upon it giving the sprays an
edge of brighter gold so that it is the most
luminous thing in the garden. And the
warm scent of it, holding something so far
beyond itself and India, something essential,
impregnated with the solace that one’s youth
and its affections are not lost, but only on
the other side of the world!</p>

<p>Another delightful thing about the
goldenrod is the way the bees and butterflies
instantly found it out. The sprays
are dotted with them all day long, swaying
and dipping with the weight of the little
greedy bodies; their hum of content stands
in the air with the warm and comfortable
scent. “This is good fare” they seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
say. “There are some things they make
better in America.” I had never before
done anything for a bee or a butterfly, it is
not really so easy, and I would not have
believed there was such pleasure in it. “<i>Le
fleur qui vole</i>”—is not that charming of
M. Bourget?</p>

<p>I suppose it argues a very empty plane
of life, but these little creatures have an
immense power of entertaining a person
who spends day after day in the theatre
of their activities. I am reminded that
here in India one ought to have marvellous
tales to tell of them, only Simla is not really
India, but a little bit of England with an
Adirondack climate and the “insect belt”
of Central Asia; and things are not so
wonderful here as you would think to look
at us on the map. Scorpions and centipedes
do come up from the plains and live in the
cracks of the wall whence they crawl out to
be despatched when the first fires are lighted,
but they have not the venom of those below.
Scorpions Atma will take hold of by the
poison bags at the end of their tails, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
hold up in the air dangling and waving their
arms; and nobody even screams at a centipede.
Millipedes which look much more
ferocious but are really quite harmless often
run like little express trains across your
bath-room walls, and very large, black, garden
spiders also come there to enjoy the
damp. They enjoy the damp, but what
they really like is to get into the muslin
curtain over the window and curl up and
die. The first time I saw one of them in
the folds of the curtain I thought it would
be more comfortable in the garden and
approached it with caution and a towel, to
put it out. Then I perceived from its behaviour—it
did not try to run away, but just
drew its legs a little closer under it, as you
or I would do if we absolutely didn’t care
what happened so long as we were left in
peace—that it had come there on purpose,
being aware of its approaching end. I decided
that the last moments of even a spider
should be respected, but every day I shook
the curtain and he drew his legs together
a little more feebly than the day before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
until at last he dropped out, the shell of
a spider, comfortably and completely dead.
I admired his expiring, it was business-like
and methodical, the thing he had next to do,
and he was so intent upon it, not in any way
to be disturbed or distracted, asking no
question of the purposes of nature, simply
carrying them out. One might moralize.</p>

<p>Talking of spiders I have just seen a fly
catch one. It was, of course, an ichneumon
fly. One has many times heard of his habit
of pouncing upon his racial enemy, puncturing
and paralyzing him and finally carrying
him off, walling him up and laying an egg
in him, out of which comes a young ichneumon
to feed upon his helpless vitals; but
one does not often see the tragedy in the
air. He held his fat prey quite firmly in
his merciless jaws and he went with <i>entrain</i>,
the villain! The victim spider and the
assassin fly! One might moralize again.</p>

<p>It is hotter than ever, and the sunlight
under the ground-glass bell has a factitious
look, as if we had here a comedy with a
scene of summer. A hawk-moth darts like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
a hummingbird in and out of the honeysuckle,
and a very fine rose-chafer all in
green and gold paces across this paragraph.
I believe there are more rose-chafers this
year than there ought to be, and Atma has
a heavy bill against them in every stage of
their existence, but they are such attractive
depredators. When I find one making
himself comfortable in the heart of a La
France, I know very well that on account
of the white grub he was once and the
many white grubs he will be again I ought
to kill him and think no more about it;
but one hesitates to send a creature out of
the world who exercises such good taste
when he is in it. I know it is quite too
foolish to write, but the extent of my vengeance
upon such a one is only to put him
into a common rose.</p>

<p>The birds are silent; the butterflies bask
on the gravel like little ships with big sails.
Even the lizards have sought temporary
retirement between the flower-pots. I am
the only person who is denied her natural
shelter and compelled to resort to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
umbrella. Tiglath-Pileser said the other
day that he thought it was quite time I
made some acknowledgment of the good it
was doing me. It <i>is</i> doing me good—of
course. But what strikes me most about
it is the wonderful patience and fortitude
people can display in having good done to
them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIII</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; HAVE had a morning of domestic
details with the Average Woman. I
don’t quite know whether one ought
to write about such things, or whether
one ought to draw a veil; I have not yet
formed a precise opinion as to the function
of the commonplace in matter intended for
publication. But surely no one should scorn
domestic details, which make our universal
background and mainstay of existence.
Theories and abstractions serve to adorn it
and to give us a notion of ourselves: but
we keep them mostly for lectures and sermons,
the monthly reviews, the original
young man who comes to tea. All would
be glad to shine at odd times, but the most
luminous demonstration may very probably
be based upon a hatred of cold potatoes and
a preference for cotton sheets. And of
course no one would dare to scorn the average
woman; she is the backbone of society.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
Personally I admire her very humbly, and
respect her very truly. For many of us, to
become an average woman is an ambition.
I think I will go on.</p>

<p>Besides, Thalia interrupted us, and Thalia
will always lend herself to a chapter.</p>

<p>The Average Woman is not affectionate
but she is solicitous, and there was the consideration
of my original situation and my
tiresome health. Then she perceived that
I had a garden and that it was a pretty garden.
I said, indifferently, that people thought
so; I knew it was a subject she would not
pursue unless she were very much encouraged,
and there was no reason at all why she
should pursue it; she would always be a
visitor in such a place, whereas there were
many matters which she could treat with
familiar intelligence. I was quite right; she
wandered at once into tins of white enamel,
where it seemed she had already spent several
industrious hours. We sympathized
deeply over the extent to which domestic
India was necessarily enamelled, though I
saw a look of criticism cross her face when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
I announced that I hoped one day to be
rich enough not to possess a single article
painted in that way—not a chair, not a
table. I think she considered my declaration
too impassioned, but she did not dissent
from it. That is a circumstance one notes
about the Average Woman: she never dissents
from anything. She never will be
drawn into an argument. One could make
the most wild and whirling statement to her,
if one felt inclined, and it is as likely as not
that she would say “Yes indeed,” or “I
think so too,” and after a little pause of
politeness go on to talk about something
else. I can’t imagine why one never does
feel inclined.</p>

<p>We continued to discuss interior decoration,
and I learned that she was preparing a
hearth seat for her drawing-room, one of
those low square arrangements projecting
into the room before the fire, upon which
two ladies may sit before dinner and imagine
they look picturesque, while the rest of
the assembled guests, from whom they quite
cut off the cheerful blaze, wonder whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
they do. The Average Woman declared
that she could no longer live without one.</p>

<p>“As time goes on one notices that fewer
and fewer average women can,” I observed
absently, and hastily added, “I mean, you
know, that of course very portly ladies—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I <i>see</i>,” said she. “No, of course
not.”</p>

<p>“So long,” I went on, pursuing the same
train of thought, “as one can sit down readily
upon a hearth seat, and especially so long
as one can clasp one’s knees upon it, one
is not even middle-aged. To clasp one’s
knees is really to hug one’s youth.”</p>

<p>“I had <i>such</i> a pretty one in Calcutta,”
said the Average Woman. “So cosy it
looked. Everybody admired it.”</p>

<p>“But in Calcutta,” I exclaimed with astonishment,
“it is always so hot—and there
are no fireplaces.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that didn’t matter,” replied she triumphantly,
“I draped the mantelpiece.
It looked just as well.” And yet there are
people who say that the Average Woman
has no imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“Talking of age,” she continued, “how
old do you suppose Mrs. —— is? Somebody
at tiffin yesterday <i>who knew the family</i>
declared that she could not be a day under
thirty-seven. I should not give her more
than thirty-five myself. My husband says
thirty-two.”</p>

<p>“About a person’s age,” I said, “what
can another person’s husband know?”</p>

<p>“What <i>should</i> you say?” she insisted. I
am sorry to have to underline so much, but
you know how the average woman talks in
italics. It is as if she wished to make up in
emphasis—but I will not finish that good-natured
sentence.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said I, “you cannot measure
Mrs. ——’s age in years! She is as old
as Queen Elizabeth and as young as the day
before yesterday. Parts of her date from
the Restoration and parts from the advent
of M. Max Nordau—” At that moment
Thalia arrived. “And that is the age of all
the world,” I finished.</p>

<p>“We were wondering,” said the Average
Woman, “how old Mrs. —— is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“<i>You</i> were wondering,” I corrected her.</p>

<p>“What does it matter?” said Thalia,
which was precisely what I should have
expected her to say. What <i>does</i> it matter?
Why should the average woman excite herself
so greatly about this particularly small
thing? How does it bear upon the interest
or the attractiveness or the value of any
woman to know precisely how many years
she counts between thirty and forty, at all
events to another of her sex? Yet to the
average woman it seems to be the all-important
fact, the first thing she must know.
She is <i>enragée</i> to find it out, she will make
the most cunning enquiries and take the
most subtle means. Much as I appreciate
the average woman, I have in this respect no
patience with her. It is as if she would
measure the pretensions of all others by
recognized rule of thumb with a view to discovering
the surplus claim and properly
scoring it down. It is surely a survival from
days when we were much more feminine
than we are now; but it is still very general,
even among married ladies, for whom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
really, the question might have an exhausted
interest.</p>

<p>“What does it matter?” said Thalia. “I
see your fuchsias, like me, have taken advantage
of a fine day to come out. What a
lot you’ve got!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, without enthusiasm, “they
were here when we came.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you like them?” exclaimed
the Average Woman, “I think the fuchsia
such a graceful, pretty flower.”</p>

<p>“It is graceful and it is pretty,” I assented.
There are any number of fuchsias, as Thalia
said, standing in rows along the paling under
the potato-creeper; the last occupant must
have adored them. They remain precisely
in the pots in which they were originally
cherished. Knowing that the first thing I do
for a flower I like is to put it in the ground
where it has room to move its feet and stir
about at night, and take its share in the joys
of the community, Tiglath-Pileser says compassionately
of the fuchsia, “It is permitted to
occupy a pot;” but I notice that he does not
select it for his button-hole notwithstanding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>Thalia looked at me suspiciously. “What
have you got against it?” she demanded, and
the Average Woman chorussed, “Now tell
us.”</p>

<p>I fixed a fuchsia sternly with my eye.
“It’s an affected thing,” I said. “Always
looking down. I think modesty can be an
overrated virtue in a flower. It is also like
a ballet-dancer, flaunting short petticoats,
which doesn’t go with modesty at all. I
like a flower to be sincere; there is no heart,
no affection, no sentiment about a fuchsia.”</p>

<p>Thalia listened to this diatribe with her
head a little on one side.</p>

<p>“You are <i>full</i> of prejudices,” said she,
“but there is something in this one. Nobody
could say ‘My love is like a fuchsia.’”</p>

<p>“It depends,” I said; “there are ladies
not a hundred miles from here who thrill
when they are told that they walk like the
partridge and shine like the moon. I
shouldn’t care about it myself.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said the Average Woman.
“That bit beyond the mignonette seems
rather empty. What are you going to put
in there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Oh, nothing,” I said.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” remarked Thalia combatively,
“when there are so many beautiful
things in the world, why you should discriminate
in favour of nothing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, why?” said the Average Woman.</p>

<p>“Well,” I replied defiantly, “that’s my
spare bedroom. You’ve got to have <i>some</i>where
to put people. I don’t like the
feeling that every border is fully occupied
and not a square inch available for any one
coming up late in the season.”</p>

<p>You can see that Thalia considers that
while we are respected for our virtues our
weaknesses enable us to enjoy ourselves.
She accepts them as an integral and intentional
part of us and from some of them she
even extracts a contemplative pleasure. The
Average Woman looks down upon such
things and I did not dare to encounter her
glance of reserved misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Thalia smiled. I felt warmed and approved.
“Alas!” said she, “my garden is
all spare bedrooms.” She lives, poor dear,
on the other side of the Jakko and has to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
wait till September for her summer. “I
see you keep it aired and ready.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Atma had freshly
turned the earth. I hold to that in the
garden; it seems to me a parallel to good
housekeeping. The new-dug mould makes
a most enhancing background; and an
empty bed, if it is only freshly made, offers
the mind as much pleasure as a gay parterre.
It is the sense, I suppose, of effort expended
and care taken, and above all it is a stretch
of the possible, a vista beyond the realized
present which is as valuable in a garden as
it is in life. Oh no, not as valuable. In
life it is the most precious thing, and it is
sparingly accorded. Thalia has it, I know,
but I looked at the Average Woman in
doubt. Thalia, whatever else she does, will
have high comedy always for her portion,
and who can tell in what scenes she will
play or at what premières she will assist?
But the Average Woman,—can one not
guess at the end of ten years what she will
be talking about, what she will have experienced,
what she will have done? I looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
at the Average Woman and wondered. She
was explaining to Thalia the qualities of
milk tea. I decided that she was probably
happier than Thalia, and that there was no
need whatever to be sorry for her. She
stayed a long time; I think she enjoyed
herself; and when she went away of course
we talked about her.</p>

<p>We spoke in a vein of criticism, and I
was surprised to learn that the thing about
the Average Woman to which Thalia took
most exception was her husband. I had
always found the poor patient creatures entirely
supportable, and I said so. “Oh,
yes,” replied Thalia impatiently, “in themselves
they’re well enough. But didn’t you
hear her? ‘<i>George adores you in “Lady
Thermidore.”</i>’ Now that annoys me.”</p>

<p>“Does it?” said I. “Why shouldn’t
George adore you in <i>Lady Thermidore</i> if
he wants to, especially if he tells his wife?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly it,” said Thalia. “If he
really did he wouldn’t tell her. But he
doesn’t. She just says so in order to give
herself the pleasure of imagining that I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
charmed to believe that George—her
George—”</p>

<p>“I see,” I said, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“They are always offering their husbands
up to me like that,” continued Thalia,
gloomily. “They expect me, I suppose, to
blush and simper. As if I hadn’t a very
much better one of my own!”</p>

<p>“They think it the highest compliment
they can pay you.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. That’s what is so objectionable.
And besides it’s a mistake.”</p>

<p>“I shall never tell you that Tiglath-Pileser
adores you,” I stated.</p>

<p>“My dear, I have known it for ages!”
said Thalia, <i>en se sauvant</i>, as they do in
French novels.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Average Woman is a little tiresome
about her husband. She is generally
charged with quoting him overmuch. I
don’t think that; his opinions are often useful
and nearly always sensible, but she certainly
assumes a far too general interest for
him as a subject upon which to dwell for
long periods. Average wives of officials are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
much more distressingly affected in this way
than other ladies are; it is quite a local
peculiarity of bureaucratic centres. They
cherish the delusion, I suppose, that in some
degree they advance the interests of these
unfortunate men by a perpetual public attitude
of adoration, but I cannot believe it is
altogether the case. On the contrary, I am
convinced that the average official husband
himself would find too much zeal in the
recounting of his following remarkable traits.
His obstinate and absurd devotion to duty.
“In <i>my</i> husband the Queen has a good bargain!”
His remarkable youth for the post
he holds,—I remember a case where my
budding affection for the wife of an Assistant
Secretary was entirely checked by this
circumstance. The compliments paid him
by his official superiors, those endless compliments.
And more than anything perhaps,
his extraordinary and deplorable indifference
to society. “I simply can<i>not</i> get my husband
out; I am positively ashamed of
making excuses for him.” When her husband
is served up to me in this guise I feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
my indignation rising out of all proportion
to its subject, always an annoying experience.
Why should I be expected to accept his
foolish idea that he is superior to society,
and admire it? Why should I be assumed
to observe with interest whether he comes
out; why indeed, so far as I am concerned,
should he not eternally stay in?</p>

<p>It comes to this that one positively admires
the woman who has the reticence to
let her husband make his own reputation.</p>

<p>What offends one, I suppose, is the lack
of sincerity. A very different case is that
of the simple soul who says, “Tom will not
allow me to have it in the house,” or “Jim
absolutely refuses to let me know her.”
One hears that with the warm thrill of
mutual bondage; one has one’s parallel
ready—the tyranny I could relate of
Tiglath-Pileser! The note of grievance is
primitive and natural; but the woman who
butters her husband in friendly council,
what excuse has she?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIV</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE rains have come. They were
due on the fifteenth of June
and they are late; this is the
twentieth. The whole of yesterday
afternoon we could see them beating up
the valleys, and punctually at midnight they
arrived, firing their own salute with a great
clap of thunder and a volley on the roof—it
is a galvanized roof—that left no room for
doubt. You will notice that it is the rains
that have come and not the rain; there is
more difference than you would imagine
between water and water. The rain is a
gentle thing and descends in England; the
rains are untamed, torrential, and visit parts
of the East. They come to stay; for three
good months they are with us, pelting the
garden, beating at the panes. It would be
difficult for persons living in the temperate
zone to conceive how wet, during this
period, our circumstances are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>One always hears them burst with a feeling
of apprehension; it is such a violent
movement of nature, potential of damage,
certain of change; and life is faced next
morning at breakfast with a gloom which is
not assumed. A dripping dulness varied by
deluges, that is the prospect for the next
ninety days. The emotions of one who will
be expected to support it under an umbrella,
with the further protection of a conifer only,
are offered, please, to your kind consideration.
I dreamed as the night wore on of
shipwreck in a sea of mountains on a cane
chair, and when I awoke, salvaged in my
bed, it was raining as hard as ever.</p>

<p>At breakfast Tiglath-Pileser said, uneasily,
that it would probably clear up in half an
hour. “It simply can’t go on like this,”
remarked Thisbe, and I saw that they were
thinking of me, under the conifer. When
you suspect commiseration the thing to do
is to enhance it. “Clear up?” said I with
indifference. “Why should it clear up? It
has only just begun.”</p>

<p>“It is all very well to sit out in the rain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
in England,” said Thisbe; “but this is quite
a different thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no,” said I. “There is only
a little more of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it continues to pelt like this, of
course—” began Tiglath-Pileser.</p>

<p>“I shall take the old green gamp,” I put
in, “it’s the biggest.”</p>

<p>They glanced at each other; I perceived
the glance though my attention was supposed
to be given to a curried egg. A word
of petition would have installed me at once
by the drawing-room fire; but a commanding
pride rose up in me and forbade the word.
Tiglath-Pileser, who holds to carrying out
a system thoroughly, asked me thoughtfully
if I wouldn’t have a little marmalade
with my egg; and the matter dropped.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards I was encamped
under the pencil-cedar and the old green
umbrella. You cannot screen your whole
person in a long chair with these two things,
and I added to myself a water-proof sheet.
It was a magnificent moment. The rain was
coming down straight and thick with a loud,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
steady drum, small flat puddles were dancing
all about me, and brooks were running under
my chair—I sat calm and regardless. I
was really quite dry and not nearly so uncomfortable
as I looked; but I presented a
spectacle of misery that afforded me a subtle
joy. The only drawback was that there was
nobody to witness it; Thisbe and Tiglath-Pileser
seemed by common consent to withdraw
themselves to the back parts. Only
Dumboo circulated disconsolately about the
verandah, with the heavy knowledge that
now without doubt it was proved that the
mistress was mad; and I wished to be
thought indifferent only, not insane. He
seemed to think that I required surveillance,
and kept an anxious eye upon me until I
sent him about his business.</p>

<p>It was a day of great affairs in the garden;
I could hear them going on all round me.
To everybody there it meant a radical change
of housekeeping; some families were coming
out and some going in, some moving up and
some down, while others would depart, almost
at once, for the season. No wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
they all talked at once in an excited murmur
under the rain. I could hear the
murmur, but I could not distinguish the
voices; between the rain and the umbrella,
most of the garden was hidden from me, and
it is a curious fact that if you cannot see a
flower you cannot hear what it says. Only
the pansy beds came within eyesight and
ear-shot, and there I could see that consternation
and confusion reigned. It is the
beginning of the end for the pansies; they
love rain in watering-pots, morning and
evening, and a bright sun all day, and
this downpour disconcerts them altogether.
They cry out, every one of them, against
the waste and improvidence of it. For another
month they will go on opening fresh
buds and uttering fresh protests, plainly disputing
among themselves whether, under
such adverse circumstances, life is worth living;
and one sad day I shall find that they
have decided it is not. I am always sorry
to see the last pansy leave the garden; it
goes with such regret.</p>

<p>I intended to be undisturbed and normal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
and to accomplish pages; but I find that
you cannot think in heavy rain. It is too
fierce, too attacking. You know that it will
not do you any harm, but your nerves are
not convinced; you can only wait in a kind
of physical suspense, like the cows in the
fields, whose single idea I am sure is, “How
soon will it be over?”</p>

<p>Well, I knew it would not be over for
ninety days, and already there were drops
on the inside of the green umbrella. I was
seriously weighing the situation when Tiglath-Pileser
appeared upon the verandah.
He had come out to say that the rains always
broke with thunder-storms, that this
was practically a thunder-storm, and that he
considered my situation, under the tallest
tree in the neighbourhood, too exposed.
He had to think of something; that was
what he thought of, and I was pleased to
find it convincing. “Shall I take it for
granted,” I inquired blandly, “whenever it
comes down in bucketfuls like this, that
there is thunder in the air, and come in?”
and Tiglath-Pileser said that he thought it
would be as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>So I am in—in to spend the day. It
does not sound in any way remarkable,
which shows how entirely custom is our
measure for the significance of things. It is
really an excursion into the known and
familiar, become unusual and exciting by banishment;
and it brings one fresh sense of
how easy it would be to make life—almost
any—vivid and interesting by a discreet and
careful use of abstinence. I am not praising
the pleasures of the anchorite; his is an
undiscriminating experience upon quite a
lower plane; but, oh, restraint, the discipline
of the greedy instinct, how it brings out the
colours of life! To have learnt this lesson
only makes it worth while to have come
through the world. People to whom a roof
is normal have never, I venture to say,
known the sense of shelter I feel to-day, the
full enclosure of the four walls, the independence
of the dry floor. The hill-man
who watches the long slant of the rain into
the valley from a cave out there on the road
to Thibet, where a little heap of cold embers
often tell of such a one’s refuging, may offer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
me intelligent sympathy—I should criticise
any one else’s.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I have been criticising other
things. The house is a place of shelter;
it is also a place of confinement, and there
are corners where the blessed air does not
sufficiently circulate. This as an abstraction
is generally accepted, but unless you pass
a good deal of time out-of-doors you can
never know it as a fact. It is not perhaps
the happiest result of living in the open
air that to the nose thus accustomed there
are twice as many smells in the world as
there were before. I have been discovering
them in various places this morning, here
a suggestion of kerosene, there a flavour of
cheese, in another spot a reminiscence of
Tiglath-Pileser’s pipe. I even pretend to
know that it was his meerschaum and not
his brier, though Thisbe thinks this preposterous.
Thisbe thinks me preposterous
altogether, vainly sniffing for the odours
which offend me, and begging me to desist
from opening windows and letting in the
rain. Dumboo, more practical, goes carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
round after me, and closes each in turn
as soon as I have left the room, with an
air of serious perturbation,—who can be
<i>jewabdeh</i>—answer-giving—for the acts of
a mad mistress? I have finally subsided
as near as possible to the window in the
breakfast-room, with the garden and the
rain outside. It has been given me to understand
that I am to have a present shortly,
and I may choose my present. For some
time I have been vainly revolving the matter;
the world seems so full of desirable
articles that one does not want; but here
an inspiration visits me—I will have another
window in the breakfast-room. There
is plenty of room for it, nothing but a wall
in the way. Where this blank wall, covered
with wall-paper, now blocks the vision, another
square of garden shall appear; it will
let in a line of blue hill, most of the pencil-cedar,
a corner of the rose-bushes, and a
whole company of poppies and corn-bottles.
A carpenter from Jullunder will make it
in a week,—Jullunder thrives upon the
export of carpenters to the hills,—and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
will be a most delicious present, giving a
pleasure every morning freshly new, much
better than anything that would have to be
locked up in a drawer. Also, when we go
away I shall be able, without a pang of self-sacrifice,
to leave it behind for the enjoyment
of other people, which is quite the
most pleasing kind of benefit to confer.</p>

<p>Very heavily it descends, this first burst
of the rains. The garden is bowed under
it; from far and near comes the sound of
rushing water down the khud-sides. The
great valleys beyond the paling are brimful
of grey, impenetrable vapour, as if the clouds,
even in dissolving, were too heavy to carry
themselves. From my asylum nothing
appears to stir or speak except the rain.
The day weeps fast and stormily, as if
night might fall before she had half deplored
enough.</p>

<p>It would be dull at the window but
for the discovery I have made in the banksia
over the arched trellis which stands, for no
purpose at all, across the garden walk that
runs round the roses. Here I strongly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
suspect the brown bird has an establishment,
and a sitting hen. So long as I myself
sat in the garden I never guessed it, he
was too clever; but he did not dream, I
suppose, that I would take to spying upon
him in ambush like this, and from here his
conduct looks most husbandly. The brown
bird joined us one afternoon about a fortnight
ago, while we were having tea on the
verandah. He perched on a flower-pot,
and hinted, in the most engaging way, that
the ground was baked and worms were
scarce, and we made him feel so welcome to
crumbs that he has constantly dropped in
upon us since. He is most venturesome
with us; he will run under our chairs and
under the table, and he loves to slip in and
out of hiding among the flower-pots. He
goes with little leaps and bounds, like a
squirrel; and he whistles with such melody
that one might very well think him a thrush.
I thought him a thrush, until one afternoon
Tiglath-Pileser said aggressively, “I don’t
believe that bird is a thrush.”</p>

<p>“Pray, then,” said I, “what is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“He belongs, nevertheless,” said Tiglath-Pileser
judicially, “to the <i>Passeres</i>.”</p>

<p>“If I asked your name,” said Delia, who
was there, “I should not be grateful to be
told that you were one of the primates,” and
we laughed at the master of the house.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” said he, “I should call him
a robin.”</p>

<p>“He’s got no red breast,” I brought
forth, out of the depth of my ignorance.</p>

<p>“He has a reddish spot under each ear,”
said Tiglath-Pileser, “and mark how his
tail turns up.”</p>

<p>“I am no ornithologist,” I said. “His
tail turns up.”</p>

<p>“How little one realizes,” quoth Thisbe,
pensively, “that a bird has ears.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Tiglath-Pileser, “that I
can decide this matter,” and disappeared
into the house.</p>

<p>“He has gone to get a book,” said
Delia, “that will settle <i>you</i>, dear lady,
you and your thrush,” and presently he
came out triumphant, as she said, with
“Wanderings of a Naturalist in India.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“‘Although differing altogether in the
colour of its plumage from the European
robin,’” he read aloud, “‘there is great
similarity in their habits. It frisks before
the door, and picks up crumbs, jerking its
tail as it hops along. How often have
associations of home been brought to mind
by seeing this pretty little warbler pursuing
its gambols before the door of an Eastern
bungalow!’”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “not often, because of
course we didn’t recognize it, but in future
they always will be,” and at that moment
the pretty little warbler put himself in profile
on the paling before us, and threw out
his little waistcoat, and threw back his little
head and whistled, and we all cried out that
he had established his identity, there could
not be any doubt of it, in face of that brave
and dainty attitude. There are some things
a bird never could pick up.</p>

<p>So it is a robin that has gone to housekeeping
there in the close-cut banksia. He
is a devoted mate; he knows by heart, perhaps
by experience, how necessary it is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
encourage, dull little wives on the nest; and,
neglectful of the hard-beating storm, he
perches as near her as may be and sends
out every dulcet variation he can think of.
To the prisoner in the house it seems a
supreme note of hope, this bird singing in
the rain.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; FIND it desirable to sit more and
more out in the rain. A little
stouter protection, a little more determination,
and the cane chair will
soon weather anything. There are still
tempestuous half-hours which drive me as
far as the verandah, but I am growing every
day more used to the steady beat and drip
about my defences, and I now know precisely
the term of resistance of every umbrella
in the house. One after the other
I put them to the proof; on a really wet
day I discourage three or four. An occasional
pelting of my person does not trouble
me, I am very water-proof; but when drops
descend upon this fair page and confuse its
sentiments I call loudly for another umbrella.
Constantly, no doubt, the cane chair
under the conifer grows a stranger
spectacle; but my family have become accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
to it and there is no one else to
see. The occasional rickshaw that passes
along the road above pays attention to nothing,
but goes as fast as it can, with the hood
up, like a deranged beetle, and if any one
rides past it is with bent head and flying
mackintosh. I have the world very much
to myself, most of the mountains when I
can see them, and all the garden. And it is
full of rewards and satisfactions, this rainy
world. The wind that pushes the clouds
up here blows over a thousand miles of sun
and sand and draws a balm from the desert
to mingle with its cool dampness, delicious
to breathe, like a cooled drink to the lungs.
It cannot be tasted in the house because of
the prevailing flavour of carpets and curtains.
Nor can anybody know, who has
not sat out under it, the delight of the slow
termination of a shower, the spacing lines
and the sparser drop-dancers on the gravel,
the jolly irregular drip from the branches on
your umbrella, the wraiths of mist skimming
over the drive and the feint thin veil slanting
against the deodars into which it all dissolves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
So invariably we are careful to wait
in the house “until it is over,”—quite over.
A pencil-cedar too, very wet, with a drop at
the end of every spine, and a soft gray light
shining through it, is a good thing to look
up into. “As if it were candied,” as Thisbe
politely conceded, and departed at once into
the house out of the damp.</p>

<p>For the first time, I have this year a rains
garden. It is a thing anybody may have,
but very few people do. As a rule gardens
in our part of the world are handed over in
the rains to slugs and their own resources.
The resources of a garden, left to itself, are
hardly ever suspected. It is impossible,
people say, to keep it down, and they sit
comfortably in the house looking out upon
the impossibility. In the hot weather they
say it is impossible to keep it up. They
complain that they are here for so short a
time that it is not worth while to do anything.
Most people are transitory in our
little town, certainly; it is generally only a
year or two in Paradise and then down again
into the Pit, but why that year or two should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
be thought less worth than others of their
lives I never can quite understand. Especially
as a flower takes such a little while to
come to you. But people are just people.</p>

<p>To me of course, peculiarly situated under
a conifer, a rains garden was a peremptory
necessity, and I have had it in my mind’s
eye for months. There was an unavoidable
fortnight, when the earlier flowers were going
out and the others only answering my invitation
as it were, promising to come, which
was not quite cheerful. The sweet-peas
fluttered for days about the verandah before
they would submit to be beaten down, and
the roses, those that were left, looked up as
if they had been for a long time in ladies’
bonnets. The mignonette grew leggy and
curious, spreading in all directions and
forgetting to flower, with a smell, moreover,
like decaying cabbage, deplorable in
mignonette; and the petunias went off with
draggled petticoats, which must have been
distressing to a flower whose principal virtue
is her neat and buxom appearance. The
snapdragons and the corn-bottles are just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
holding on anyhow and the phloxes seem
not to know what to do; but the poppies
were dashed out in a single night, and quantities
of things in pots have been considerately
removed by Atma to the back parts, there
to meet dissolution in private.</p>

<p>But now everything that craves or loves
the rain is coming on. I should not be so
proud of my potato-vine; I did not plant
it, but somebody probably, who looked down
from here and saw the flame of the mutiny
light up the land. He has my thanks; he
has left for himself a steadfast memorial.
So eager is it to do him credit that every
hot weather shower a twig will clothe itself
in white; and now, when the time is fully
come it trembles everywhere over the paling
against the sky and heaps up its blossoms
among its glossy leaves like snow. That is
not idle simile; it takes blue shadows and
fills up chinks, it is exactly like snow. The
verandah is odorous with lilies, from the tall
curling Japanese kind, as opulent as a lily
can be to the simple and delicate day lilies
that love this world so little. All the lilies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
live in the verandah except the strenuous
peppered orange kind which Tiglath-Pileser
declares is not the tiger-lily and which bears
itself most gallantly under the rain, standing
like a street lamp in the darkest corners,
and those strange crimson and yellow Tigridæ
(I am sorry I do not know their Christian
name) that roll up so unexpectedly with
us in the middle of the morning. I must
say I like a flower that you can depend upon.
Mr. Johnson speaks contemptuously
of the Tigridæ, so I suppose they are common
enough, but to me they were new and
very remarkable, and when they began to
come out I asked Thalia to lunch to see
them. When she arrived, at two o’clock,
every one of them had gone into the likeness
of a duck’s head, with a satirical red and
yellow eye that almost winked at us. I was
prepared to ask Thalia to admire the Tigridæ,
but such conduct puts one off. I am
still willing to concede that it is wonderful;
but you do not want a flower to astonish
you; its functions are quite different. I
have taken occasion to point out this to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
Thisbe, when she complains that she is not
original.</p>

<p>Tall stocks of tuberose—quite three feet—stand
among the rose-bushes in front of
the drawing-room windows; but they turn
brown almost as fast as they open; next
year I will plant them under the eaves for
more shelter. A clump of cannas, spikes
of flame, waving splendid Italian and African
leaves, red-brown and brown-green, with
coleas of all colours sitting round their feet,
lord it at chosen corners on each side of the
drive. Even on a shelf you may have features;
it is all a matter of relation. If your
scale is only simple enough the most surprising
incident is possible; and of this the
moral certainly lies in the application of it.
Masses of pink and white hydrangeas on this
principle make the garden look like a Japanese
print; they are so big and blotchy and
yet so simply, elegantly effective. They are
distributed wherever a tub will improve the
shelf-scape; like Diogenes the hydrangea
must have its tub. Put him in the ground
and at once he grows woody and branchy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
and leafy, imagining perhaps that he is intended
to become a shrub. Thus he can be
seen to profit by his limitations—of how
many more of us may this be said! The
lobelia—a garden should always be provided
with plenty of lobelia, to give it hope—is
flushing into the thick young leaf with
a twinkle here and there to show what it
could do if the rain would stop for just ten
minutes; and the salvia is presently blue,
though sparingly, as is its nature. The
fuchsias care nothing for the rain and are
full of flounces purple and pink; but nobody
takes it quite like the begonias, who sit
up unblinking crimson and brick-dust and
mother-of-pearl, with their gay yellow hearts
in their splendid broad petals, saying plainly
“We like this.” And dahlias everywhere,
single and double, opening a cheerful eye
upon a very wet world. The dahlia took
possession of Simla—I have looked it up—the
same year the Government of India
did, and it has made itself equally at home.
It grows profusely not only in our bits of
garden but everywhere along the khud-sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
that border the public highways. It mixes
itself up with Finance and Foreign Relations;
it nods under the Telegraph Office
and sways about the Military Department.
It does as it pleases, no one attempts to
govern it; it paints our little mountain
town with the colours of fantasy and of
freedom.</p>

<p>Sunflowers and nasturtiums take as kindly
to bureaucratic conditions. We consider
them fellows of the baser sort and plant
them all behind, the sunflower tall along the
lattice between us and the road above, the
nasturtiums scrambling and blazing down
the khud-side beneath. The nasturtiums
make a mere cloth of gold, there is not much
entertainment to be got out of them; but
on heavily pouring days when I have betaken
myself to the attic-window level with
them, I have found good company in the
sunflowers. Thoughtfully considered, the
sunflower has no features to speak of; an
eye, and you have mentioned them all, yet
many comedians might envy that furnishing.
His personality is evasive; I have idly tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
to draw him, and have reproduced a sunflower
but no gentleman. It lies in a nuance
of light across that expressive round, which
may say anything, or merely stare. One
looks intelligently to the west, another hopefully
to the east. Two little ones cower together;
another glances confidently up at its
tall mother, another folds its leaves under
its chin and considers the whole question of
life with philosophy. On a particularly wet
day I find a note to the effect that a small
sunflower called across to me, “I am just
out this morning and it’s pouring. A nice
look-out, but I’ll try to bear up.” That
was the day on which I distinctly saw a
sunflower shut its eye.</p>

<p>With Tiglath-Pileser everything is secondary
at present to the state of the drains
and the kitchen roof. The drains are open
channels down the khud-side, the kitchen
roof is of tin, and when it leaks enough to
put the fire out the cook comes and complains.
He is a Moog cook, which means
that he prefers to avoid the disagreeable, so
he waits until it is actually out before he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
says anything. When, between showers, we
walk abroad upon the shelf my footsteps
naturally tend to the border where the wild
puce-coloured Michaelmas daisies are thickening
among the goldenrod, and his would
take the straightest direction to the plumber
and the coolies who are making another stone
ditch for him. To me there is no joy in repairing
a kitchen roof, nor can I ever decide
whether it should be tarred or painted, while
to Tiglath-Pileser the union of Michaelmas
daisies and goldenrod, though pleasing, is
a matter of trivial importance. So we have
agreed upon the principle of a fair partition
of interest. He comes and assumes moderate
enthusiasm before my hedge of purple
and yellow; I go and pronounce finally that
nothing could be uglier than either paint or
tar for the kitchen roof. By such small
compromises as these people may hold
each other in the highest estimation for
years.</p>

<p>The consideration of the kitchen roof
reminds me of poor Delia, from whom I
had a letter this morning. She has rejoined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
her husband in a frontier outpost, where
the Department of Military Works had
somewhat neglected their quarters. Their
position—that of Captain and Mrs. Delia—in
this weather is trying to a degree. In
a particularly heavy storm recently the rain
came in upon them in such floods that they
were obliged to take refuge under the table.
Imagine the knock of a stranger at the gate
under such circumstances! It was better
than that—it was the knock of a wayfaring
Sapper come to <i>inspect the bungalow</i>.
How great must Delia’s joy have been in
making him comfortable under the table!
And there they sat, all three, for fifteen
mortal hours, subsisting, for the cook-house
was carried away, upon ginger-nuts and
chocolates and a bottle of anchovies. The
more remote service of Her Majesty our
Queen-Empress involves some curious situations.
The Sapper, Delia writes, went
forth no longer a stranger; fifteen hours
spent together under a table would naturally
make a bond for life. One might also trust
Delia, whose mission is everywhere to strike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
a note of gaiety and make glad the heart of
man, to give the circumstance a character
sufficiently memorable. Almost, if four
would not have been a crowd, I could have
wished myself there too, under the table.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVI</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; HAVE heard crying in the nursery;
it is the most babyish and plaintive
repetition of the old birds’ note, but
it grows daily stronger, more importunate.
The parent birds utter six notes,
dwelling on the fourth in long musical
appeal, the babies have learned only the
fourth, the one that really tells when you
are hungry; it is a little pipe, ridiculous to
tears. The pretty little warbler pursues his
gambols more energetically than ever before
the door of our Eastern bungalow now, his
wife comes with him and they are more
punctual than we are at meals, always in the
verandah, on the impatient hop, for breakfast
and lunch and tea, though dinner-time
finds them reluctantly in bed. I will go so
far as to say that if I am late in the morning
the father bird comes to my window and
asks whether I am aware that I am keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
two families waiting—if that is not his idea
why does he so markedly whistle there?
Further I expect to be believed when I say
that I whistle him my apologies and he
replies, and we frequently have quite long
conversations through the window before I
actually appear. They are such a young
couple and so absorbed in their domestic
affairs that we take a great interest in them.
It is a delight to find out a bird’s doings
and plans, and his nest is the only clue. At
other times how private they are, the birds!
We know that they are about, and that is
all.</p>

<p>One real service I have been able to render
the robins—in throwing stones at the
crows. The crow has a sleek and clerical
exterior, but inside he is as black-hearted a
villain as wears feathers. He is a killer and
eater of other people’s offspring. Early in
the season he marks the nest, but eggs are
not good enough for him, he waits until
hatching time is well over and then descends
upon it with his great sharp jaws ravaging
and devouring. The other day a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
bird took refuge from a crow in my bath-room.
It was huddled up in a corner and I
thought it a rat, but closer approach revealed
it a baby mina, and through the open door I
saw the enemy’s impudent black head peering
in. He sailed away with imprecations on his
beak and the mina was restored to its family;
Atma fortunately knew where they lived.
Two crows have marked our robins for their
next dinner, and I am much interrupted by
the necessity for disappointing them. I
must say one is not disposed by such a circumstance
as a nest to an over-confident
belief in those disguising arrangements of
nature that are so much vaunted in books
of popular science. What could betray a
nestful to the marauder more quickly than
this perpetual treble chorus? Nothing, I
am sure, unless the valiant declamation of its
papa, who sometimes takes an exposed perch
and tells the world exactly what he would do
to a crow, if he could only catch him. Why
are not young birds taught the wisdom of
silence and old ones the folly of vaunting?
Because birds and lizards and insects and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
things are not taught half as much as we
imagine, and as to the protective colour of a
robin I believe it only happens to be brown.
In this Thisbe agrees with me; the amount
of popular science which is not in Thisbe’s
possession would make many a humble home
happy. The small events of a garden, as I
must apologize for pointing out once more,
become important to any one who lies all day,
warm or cold, awake or sleepy there, and I
went in to tea lately bursting with the information
that the tits had come. “The Titts,”
said Thisbe meditatively. “Did we know
them last year?” “I rather think we did,”
I replied, “Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Titt. I
saw them this morning, but they didn’t leave
cards.” At which I was obliged to dodge a
suddenly illumined, perfectly undeserved
sofa-cushion.</p>

<p>The garden is full of birds just now; they
are for ever wanting to make new introductions,
it is almost impossible to pursue the
simplest train of thought. None of them
are very constant except the robins and the
woodpeckers and a pair of minas that have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
built in a disused chimney and squeal defiance
at the crows all day long from the
eavestrough,—no crow was ever yet bold
enough to go down a chimney after his prey.
The rest come and go, I never know what
they are at, or even, to tell the truth, how to
address them. They appear suddenly out
of nowhere and fly in companies from tree
to tree, or settle down to an industrious meal
all together under the rose-bushes, as if by
common consent they had decided to picnic
there; perhaps I shall not see them again for
two or three days. Among the branches
they take one direction, the tiny tree-climbers
with yellow-green breasts are like young
leaves flying. They add to life a charming
note of the unexpected, these sudden flights
of little birds; I wish I knew them to speak
to....</p>

<p>It must be explained that this is the following
day, and that an event of a very
disturbing kind has taken place in the mean
time. The rain was coming down in sheets
this morning as Tiglath-Pileser and I stood
by the window after breakfast. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
nest in the banksia came the most keen and
mournful protest. For an instant it would
stop when the old birds came and filled the
little throats; then the plaint against life
and circumstances, quite heartbreaking in
accents so youthful, would begin again, and
go on until it seemed to us too grievous
to be borne. Heavily and heavily fell the
rain. “I wonder the little beasts aren’t
drowned out,” said Tiglath-Pileser. The
close-cut roof of the banksia seemed a very
poor protection to persons standing in the
house.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we do something?” I suggested
“An umbrella?” but Tiglath-Pileser
thought an umbrella would be too difficult
to fix. He went away, however, and out
of his own wisdom and understanding he
produced a mackintosh. This with a walking-stick
and infinite pains and precautions
he spread over the banksia, the rain descending
upon his devoted head, I admonishing
from the window. The crying ceased
instantly, and though we waited for some
minutes it did not recommence. Evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the little things were more comfortable,
perhaps they had gone to sleep. “That,”
said I to Tiglath-Pileser as he turned away,
“was a real kindness.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later I was still at the window.
No sound from the nest. At a little
distance the mother bird hopped about
anxiously, something evidently on her mind.
I watched her for a long time and she did
not go up to the nest. “The old birds,”
thought I, “are afraid of the mackintosh.
It is better to drown than to starve,” and
I picked my way out among the puddles
with a chair in one hand and an umbrella
in the other and managed to get the thing
off. And there at the foot of the trellis sat
a little helpless bunch of feathers with round
bright eyes and a heart beating inside,—a
baby robin tumbled out.</p>

<p>I picked the adventurer up and took him
into the house. He regarded me without
distrust, comfortable in the warmth of my
hand, but when I put him down he sent out
no uncertain sound to say that he was unfriended.
I have often tried to feed fledgelings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
it is an impossible charge; and my
advice as to this one was to put him on the
window-ledge where his mother might do it.
There he sat up with his back to the world
and, looking at me with confidence, unexpectedly
opened wide his preposterous futile
yellow beak. It was as if a gnome had suddenly
spoken—before the gaping demand
I was helpless, full of consternation. “You
pathetic little idiot,” I reflected aloud, “what
can <i>I</i> do for you!” and of course by the
time bread and water arrived the beak was
hermetically sealed, as usual. I sat down
with confidence, however, to await events,
and presently the small brown mother, saying
all sorts of things in an undertone, came
slipping in and out among the rose-stems
below; and with much relief I saw the wanderer
drop over the sill and join her. They
made off together very quietly, and again
I watched, uneasily, the nest. No sound,
no parent birds, and as time went on still
silence and abandonment. I decided that
the young ones had been drowned or chilled
to death before we thought of protecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
them, that the friendly mackintosh had come
too late; and in some depression I went out
to see. By standing on a chair I could just
reach, and thrusting my hand through the
wet leaves I felt for the little corpses. The
nest was empty!</p>

<p>It is a novel and rather a laughable sensation
to be taken in—completely sold—by
a bird. How she managed it I cannot
imagine, for it all happened under my eyes
and I saw nothing, but one by one she must
have enticed her family out into a most
unattractive world some days before their
time, alarmed at the shrouding mackintosh.
The last had got only as far as the foot of
the trellis when I found it. She had out-witted
Providence. I sent for Atma and
together we prowled and searched about the
garden in the lessening rain. Presently he
paused beside the closest tangles of the
potato-creeper, “<i>Chupsie!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> said he—the
word was half a whisper, half a soft whistle—and
bent down. I looked too, and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
they sat in a row, three soft, surprised,
obedient little feather-balls, well hidden, and
waiting no doubt to see what in this astonishing
wilderness would happen next. I
got back to the window in time to receive
the parent birds’ opinion of me, full-throated,
unabridged. They poured it out
from perches commanding the banksia, from
which they could see the Thing removed
and their premature flitting quite foolish and
futile. Plainly they connected me with the
horrid dream that for an hour had cloaked
all their horizon, and it <i>was</i> a murderous
scolding. Ten days of steady rain and then
this misfortune! Every other bird was
silent in shelter, only these two poured
forth their tale of dolorous injustice.
What weather to be obliged to fledge in—pretty
accommodation for a young family
in a potato-creeper! Was I not aware that
they had been brought up in the rains
themselves, hatched exactly this time last
year? Could I not conceive that they
might be able to mind their own business?
“When you have quite finished,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
I whistled humbly, “I’ll explain,” but I
couldn’t get a word in, as the saying is,
edgeways, and finally I fled, leaving them
still expressing their opinion of well-intentioned
people.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVII</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE have arrived at September and
the rains are “breaking.” For
two months and a half they
have trampled upon us steadily,
armies on the march; now they come in scattered
battalions and make off as if pursued.
The attack, too, is as erratic; it will hammer
hard upon the kitchen while not a drop falls
on the verandah, or a great slant will sweep
down the nearest valley while we look on in
dry security from the shelf. Here in the
garden a wall of mist will often surround me,
with the sun shining brightly inside; it turns
the shelf into a room, and makes one think
of the impalpable barrier of one’s environment,
possible to break in any direction but
never broken, always there, the bound of
one’s horizon and the limit of one’s activities.
I wonder if Tiglath-Pileser will call
that far-fetched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>Thin, ragged, white clouds sail over the
rose-bushes, just low enough to touch the
fresh red shoots, which are now as lovely to
look at, all in new curling leaf, as ever they
can be in full rose time. That of course is
written when there are no roses here to contradict
me. There is one red-brown tone
that one never sees except on a new leafing
rose-bush and in the eyes of some animals,
and there is a purple which is mixed nowhere
else at all. And it all shines—how it
shines!—under the soft cloud fringes, and
when by accident a full-hearted deep-pink
rose comes and sits alone among these young
twigs and sprays the sight gives that strange
ache of pleasure that hints how difficult perpetual
ecstasy would be to bear. The rose-bed
sleeps in the rains, but it sleeps with one
eye open; I seldom look in vain for at least
one flower. Now it is full of buds; the rose
of yesterday is only waiting for to-morrow.
Maréchal Niels have waited in a different way;
they have not put out new roses but they have
clung obstinately to the old ones. “At once
the silken tassel of my purse tear, and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
treasure on the garden throw” is no part of
the Maréchal Niels’ philosophy. It hangs
a heavy head and clings to every petal, reluctantly
giving up day by day a moiety of its
sweetness and lasting so unwarrantably long
that in sheer indignation I frequently cut off
its head. The garden rejoices wildly now,
all the rains-flowers are gayer than ever,
and daily confess to the sun that they never
really pretended to do without him. A new
lease of vitality has sprung up everywhere;
even the poor sticks that Atma has propped
up the dahlias with, have forgotten that they
have been cut off untimely and are trying to
bud. There is sadness in this and I will not
consider it.</p>

<p>The crows are moved to speak in all sorts
of strange languages, including a good deal
of English. One took his seat on the
very swaying top of a deodar this morning
and distinctly ejaculated “Oh <i>Bother</i>!
Oh <i>Bother</i>! Oh <i>Bother</i>!” with a guttural
throaty emphasis that excited me at last to
an unfriendly stone; whereat he went from
bad to worse and cursed me. The crow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
that superintends the East is a strange bird,
never happy, seldom in a good humour.
He declaims, he soliloquizes, he frequently
flies off and says “I’ll enquire;” but his
principal note is that of simple derision and
he plainly finds humbug in everything. He
has no period of tender innocence; some
crows are older than others but nobody has
ever seen a young crow. There is nothing
like him in England; the rooks make as
much noise perhaps, but only for a little
while in the evening; the crow’s comment
upon life is perpetual. Remote, across a
valley, it is a kind of fantastic chorus to the
reckless course of men; overhead it is a
criticism of the most impertinent and espionage
without warrant. These, of course, are
only country crows; in the cities, like other
bad characters, they take greater liberties, becoming
more objectionable by sophistication.</p>

<p>The butterflies have come back as if by
appointment; one big blue and black fellow
is carrying on a violent flirtation with a
fuchsia under my very nose. She hasn’t
much honey, and he, according to Tiglath-Pileser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span> 
has hardly anything to extract it with.
I fear, in the cynicism of our contemporary
Gauls, <i>il perd terriblement son temps</i>, but it
seems to amuse them both, and why comment
more severely upon the charming fooling of
affinities? The butterflies alight so differently
now upon the gravel drive, which
is still glistening wet; they pause there
on lightest tiptoe with waving wings; a
butterfly hates cold feet. The bees are as
busy and as cheery as ever; I have wasted
the last ten minutes in watching a bumblebee,
with the most persuasive hum, sucking
the last of their sweetness out of the corn-bottles.
The bee clings and the flower
drops over; the old pretty garden idyll
never loses its power to please. Dear me,
if it would always rain and be unattractive
I might get something done; as it is....
That was rather a sharp shower, and I
noticed that the hawk-moth courting the
salvias, braved it through. One would
have thought that the big drops would have
reduced him to a tiny ball of wet fluff in
two minutes, but he has gone on darting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
from flower to flower quite indifferent. Last
night a hawk-moth dined with us, on the
dahlias in the middle of the table. He
thought it a charming sunny day under the
lamps, and enjoyed himself enormously,
only leaving with the ladies as he objected
to tobacco. We should be delighted to see
him again.</p>

<p>A morning ride, I am glad to say, is not
considered an adventure into the world, and
morning rides are again possible without
the risk of a drenching. I have left Pat
and Arabi in the seclusion of their stables all
this time, but for no fault, as we should say
if we were selling them. Horses, I fear I
am of those who fondly think, were created
first in a mood of pure pleasure, and a careful
Providence then made men to look after
them. I should not like to tell Thisbe
this; she takes the orthodox view about the
succession of beasts and it might make her
consider one unsound; but I do not mind
saying it in print where it is likely to do
less harm. Besides, my friend the Bengal
Lancer entirely agrees with me, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
is what one might call a professional opinion.
Pat and Arabi came walking in on the shelf
one spring morning a year and a half ago,
very meek and sorry for themselves, having
climbed up every one of fifty-eight miles
and seven thousand feet on very little, probably,
but hay. They came out of a kicking,
squealing herd in the Rawalpindi fair, where
Tiglath-Pileser bought them on a day with
their full respective equipment of hill-ropes,
a ragged blanket, a tin bucket and a valet
for less than twenty pounds apiece. The
price seems low when you consider that
Arabi’s papa was a Persian of pedigree
and Pat’s an English thoroughbred. It
is due to certain liberal provisions of an
all-wise Government which nobody is
compelled to discuss except the officials of
the Remount Department. It will be
enough to say that we do not boast of their
connections on the maternal side, and painfully
try to subdue all characteristics which
seem to hark back that way. Their siring
is by dirty scrip established, but in this
country it is a wise foal that knows his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
own mother. Arabi has a pink streak on
his nose which was plainly one of his
mother’s charms, but this, as I cannot see
it when I am on his back, troubles me less
than his four white stockings and hoofs to
match, which were also bequeathed to him
by her. But his glossy coat and the arch
of his neck and his paces he inherits from his
more distinguished parent, after whom also we
have had the weakness to name him. I don’t
like to think of Arabi’s tie with the country;
she probably went in an ekka<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> with a string
of blue beads across her forehead; but Pat’s
mother’s family was pure tribal Waziri,
which means that with the manners and
make of your English sire you come into
the world with the wiry alertness your maternal
grandfather learned in getting round
lofty mountain corners in a hurry, and a
way of lifting your feet in trotting over
stony country that is pretty to see, and
a pride in your dark grey coat and iron
muscles that there is no need to conceal
either. Of course you may also inherit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Waziri irritability of temperament. Pat, in
a moment of annoyance, one day early last
season, cow-kicked the Head of the Army
Veterinary Department, but that was before
he had been long enough in Simla to know
who people were. He would not dream of
doing such a thing now; at least he might
dream of it, but that is all. He is a noble
animal and he has his ambitions. I sometimes
think they are directed against the
pair of fat Australian cobs that draw the
carriage of the Commander-in-Chief. Waziris
of all classes dislike the Commander-in-Chief;
and Pat may very well have a blood
feud on his hoofs to avenge.</p>

<p>Pat is the prouder, the more daring animal
of the two; Arabi merely champs and
pretends to bite his groom to show that he
too is of noble blood. Pat will take the
lead past a perambulator any day and will
only slightly consider a length of unexpected
drain pipe along the road. But even Pat
has his objects of suspicion, and chief among
them is a man, any man on foot in black
clothes. At such a person he will always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
shy violently. This is a cause of great
inconvenience and embarrassment to us.
There is one perfectly inoffensive gentleman,
rather stout, who beams upon the
world through his spectacles with unvarying
amiability, whose perfectly respectable occupation
no doubt compels him to wear
black, and whom it is our misfortune constantly
to meet. Neither soft words nor
smiting will induce Pat to pass this person
without a wild affrighted curve away from
him. The first time he smiled; the second
time he looked mildly surprised; the third
time he mantled with indignation, and now
he always mantles. It has gone, I assure
you, quite beyond a joke. And we, what
can <i>we</i> do? You cannot apologize for a
thing like that. One’s usual course when a
pony shies is to take him up to the object
and let him sniff it so that he will know
better the next time, but how ask an elderly,
self-respecting gentleman to allow himself to
be sniffed in that way? This morning I
saw the object coming, and had an inspiration.
“Let us turn round,” said I to Tiglath-Pileser,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
“and let him pass <i>us</i>.” So we
turned and waited, with the air of expecting
some one from the opposite direction. The
man in black came nervously on and Tiglath-Pileser
laid a reassuring hand on Pat’s
neck. Would you believe it, Pat stood like
an angel, and <i>the man in black shied</i>! Shied
badly. And went on looking more furious
than ever. We daily expect to have some
kind of writ served on us, and do not at
all know what steps we should take.</p>

<p>The ponies went excitedly this morning,
as they always do after a storm like the one
we had last night. “Ridiculous animal,”
said I to Arabi as he paused to look askance
at a small boulder that had slipped down
the khud. “This is the same old road you
travelled many yesterdays and will travel
many to-morrows. Foolish beast, of what
are you afraid?” Tiglath-Pileser reproved
me. “To us,” said he, “it is the same old
road, but to a really observant person like
Arabi it presents fifty significant changes.
He in his stable listened to the rain last
night with emotions quite different from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
yours in your bed. To him it meant that
the young grass was everywhere springing
and the turf everywhere softening under foot,
and no doubt he reflected once more upon
the insoluble problem presented by heel-ropes
and your meals in a trough. This
morning his experienced eye discovers all he
expected and more,—puddles, channels,
and other suspicious circumstances. That
stone was not there yesterday, no doubt a
wild beast had unearthed it and was sitting
behind it as we passed, waiting for just such
a breakfast as Arabi knows he comprises.
That the wild beast didn’t happen to be
there on this occasion was great luck for
Arabi and you can see he is relieved.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, unsympathetic, “I think
a good deal of it is nonsense all the same,”
and as we approached the next lurking lion
I gave Arabi a sound cuff that drew off his
attention and he cantered past it without a
word.</p>

<p>The familiar road wound round our own
hill, the Roy-Regent’s hill crowned with his
castle, and Summer Hill. It would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
entertaining to be as observant as Arabi and
find wonders round every curve; we come
far short of that and sometimes confess the
great book of nature before us a little dull for
lack of the writing of man. It is possible
that mountains may suggest mere altitude,
especially mountains like the Himalayas,
wall behind wall, waves transfixed in long
unbroken lines against the sky; one cannot
always feel a passion of admiration for mere
matter at an inconvenient level. But their
new mood of the rains makes them beautiful,
almost interesting. The mist rises
among them and turns them cleverly into
the peaks and masses they ought to be, and
a slope flashes in the brilliant sun and a
ravine sinks in the purple shade, and the
barest shoulder is cloaked in green velvet.
“They would give a good deal to see <i>that</i>
from the Row,” I say boastfully, and Tiglath-Pileser
responds “Yes indeed,” and we
both look at it as if we were the proprietors,
momentarily almost inclined to admit it as a
compensation.</p>

<p>The jungle triumphs in the rains; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
overwhelms the place. Even on the shelf it is
hard enough to cope with, creeping up, licking
and lipping the garden through the paling;
but out upon the public khud-sides it is unchecked
and insatiable. We hate the jungle;
it is so patient and designing and unremitting,
so much stronger than we are. Such
constant war we have to make upon it
merely to prevent it from swallowing us
alive. It will plant a toadstool in your
bedroom and a tree in your roof; it shrinks
from nothing. That is why we hear newcomers
from tidy England in rapture upon
the glorious freedom of the wilderness with
grim displeasure; and point to the crooked
squares of our pathetic little estates, painfully
redeemed and set smugly about with
posies, saying “Admire <i>that</i>!” And it is
so demoralizing, the jungle. The oak, for
instance, at home, is a venerable person we
all respect and some of us used to worship.
Here he is a disreputable old Bacchus with
an untrimmed beard and ferns sticking to his
branches. Certain English flowers even, alas
that I should say it! have left the paths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
propriety and taken permanently to unregulated
living. The dahlia has never repented,
and the tiger-lilies brazen it out,
but the little blue face of a convolvulus I
met this morning, strayed away in the company
of a snake-plant and a young rhododendron,
said with wistful plainness, “I was
a virtuous flower once!”</p>

<p>Everything is still very damp, and in the
shade very chill, and we were glad enough
to escape the cloud that suddenly sobered
the highway just as we turned in upon the
shelf. A figure moved along the road in
the greyness, came closer, making automatic
movements of head and hands, passed
us—a coolie eating a cucumber. It was a
long and thick cucumber, and he was eating
the rind and the seeds, everything. It
seemed a cold, unsuitable, injudicious thing
for even a coolie to eat in the rain. We
hoped it was vicious indulgence, but we
feared it was his breakfast.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVIII</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE have entered upon the period
of our great glory and content;
it is second summer in
these hills, with just a crisp
hint of autumn coming. There is nothing
left of the rains but their benediction; all
day long the sun draws the scent out of the
deodars and makes false promises to the
garden, where they believe it is spring.
The field-daisies and the hollyhocks and
the mignonette are all in second bloom and
the broom down the khud has kindled up
again. The person who is really puzzled
is the lilac. We have a lilac bush. I assure
you it is not everybody who can say
so in the town of Simla; the lilac is most
capricious about where she will stay and
where she won’t stay. We have only one;
all her children either die young or grow
up dwarfs. However, after blooming in
the most delicious and heartbreaking manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
in April, fainting through June and
going quite distracted in the rains, the lilac
now finds new sap in her veins and the
temptation assails her to flower regardless
of the calendar. Yet she doesn’t, poor dear,
quite know how; something is lacking to the
consummation of April, and the fictitious joy
she grasps at comes out in ragged little
bunches that stick straight up at the end of
the wood of the topmost branches. Nevertheless
it is pure lilac, enough for a button-hole,
and matter to boast of, lilac in October.</p>

<p>For all these reasons I was perfectly happy
this morning until twenty minutes past ten
o’clock. Atma and I had been transplanting
some cactus dahlias to fill up an empty
place. It is a liberty I wouldn’t have taken
at this time of year, but Atma says that he
can deceive the dahlias. “By giving much
water,” he explains, “they will take no
notice,” and he has been craftily setting
them down in little ponds. I had a dispute
with him about a plant, which he declared
was a lily. To settle the matter, as
soon as my back was turned, he dug it up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
and triumphantly sought me. “Behold,”
said he, “it has an onion.” He was distressed
to contradict me, but behold it <i>had</i>
an onion. The connection between an onion
and a lily was simpler perhaps to Atma
than it would be to many people; but I
conceded it. Then came a pedlar of apples
from a neighbouring garden. We shall
have apples of our own in time, but our
neighbour down the khud thought of it
three or four years before we did, and there
is no particular reason to wait. Our neighbour’s
sturdy retailer squatted discouraged
on his haunches before me. His brown
muscles stood out in cords on his arms and
legs, his face was anxious and simple like a
child’s. “If your honour will listen,” said
he, “half over Simla I have carried this
burden of apples, and it is no lighter. My
words are good and I go always to the
verandah, but the sahib-folk will not buy.”</p>

<p>“And is that,” said I, eyeing the fruit,
“a strange thing, worthy one?”</p>

<p>He picked up an apple and held it disparagingly,
at arm’s-length, in front of him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
“Certainly they are going rotten,” said he
simply. “And the more they rot the louder
is the anger of the mistress when I carry
them back. Your honour will listen—if
apples rot is it the fault of the servant?
No,” he answered himself with solid conviction,
“it is the fault of God.”</p>

<p>He sat in the sun content—content to
sit and talk of his grievance with his load
on the ground. I smiled at his dilemma,
and he smiled back; but gravity quickly
overtook him, it was a serious matter.</p>

<p>“Seven days ago, when they were sound,”
he went on, “the gardener himself took
them and sold many. Now he gives me
the command, and because I do not sell
there is talk of a donkey.”</p>

<p>“Truly you are no donkey, worthy one,”
said I soothingly. “All the donkeys are
employed by the washermen to carry home
the clothes. You are a large, fine, useful
Pahari. What is the price of the apples?
Some of them are good.”</p>

<p>“It is true talk that the mistress said ten
annas a seer,” he replied eagerly, “but if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
your honour wishes to pay eight annas I
will say that your honour, seeing the rottenness,
would give no more.”</p>

<p>I would not profit by the rottenness since
it did not concern me, so he picked out of
his best for me with exclamations, “Lo, how
it is red!” “Listen, this one will be a
honey-wallah!” and almost more polishing
than I could bear. The cloud departed from
his honest face, it was that I had paid for;
and when Tiglath-Pileser passing by said
that I had been imposed upon I was indignant.
He, the master, would not have an
apple though they are really very good, and
neither do I feel so disposed; they must be
made into a pudding. We talked for a little
while of the annoyance of reaching that critical
time of life when one looks askance at
a casual apple. In early youth it is a trifle
to be appropriated at any hour; between
the ages of ten and fourteen it is preferable
the last thing before going to bed. After
that ensues a period of indifference, full of
the conviction that there are things in the
world more interesting than apples; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
by the time one again realizes that there is
nothing half so good, circumstances have
changed so that it is most difficult to decide
when to eat them. A raw apple in the American
fashion before breakfast is admitted by
the mass of mankind to have a too discouraging
effect upon everything else, and all
will grant that it is impossible to do justice
to its flavour, impossible to cope with it in
any way, after a meal. It is not elusive—like
the grape or the lychee; it is far too
much on the spot. There remains the impromptu
occasion, but you have long since
come to regard with horror anything “between
meals.” A day arrives when the fact
stares you in the face that there is no time
at which to eat an apple. Tiglath-Pileser
and I considered it together this morning;
but we were philosophic, we didn’t mind,
we remembered that up to threescore years
and ten there would probably always be
somebody to bake them for us and were
happy, nevertheless. Then Tryphena came
and stayed an hour, and now I am not so
happy as I was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>I would not dwell upon her, I would pass
to other themes, but one has a feeling that
Tryphena has been too much omitted from
accounts of our little town. Such chronicles
have been somehow too playful; one would
think we did nothing but discover affinities
and listen to the band and eat expensive
things in tins. One would think life was all
joy and pleasure whereas there are Associations
of every kind. Whatever may have
been the case in the golden age, or the time
of Lord Lytton, I believe that the great
over-fed conscience of Great Britain now
sends out more Tryphenas every year, and
their good works have to be seriously
reckoned with in considering the possibility
of remaining here. We have our traditions,
of course, but we are practically compelled
to live upon them, and it seems to me that
a distant world should hear not only of our
declining past but of what we have increasingly
to put up with. I would not have
invited Tryphena to occupy a chapter, but
as she has walked in without this formality
she might as well stay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>Indeed I would not have invited her.
She is the kind of Tryphena that never
comes to see you unless you are ill. I am
not so agreeable when I am ill—I imagine
few people are—and I prefer visits, at such a
time, only from people who are fond of seeing
me when I am well. Why in heaven’s
name, when you are feverish or aguish or
panting for breath, you should be expected
to accept as a “kindness” a visit from a
person who never thinks of you until you
become a helpless object to whet her righteousness
on, who comes and inflicts a personality
upon you to which the most robust
health only enables you to be barely polite,
is to me an irritating conundrum. I had
taken particular pains to be reported to
Tryphena as entirely convalescent, “quite
out of the doctor’s hands;” I did not want
to be on her parish books. Why should I
suffer to enable her to do her duty? Why
should she have things put down to her
credit at my expense? This does not seem
to me reasonable or proper and I am averse
to it. Yet I have told her, such is my hypocrisy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
how good it was of her to come, and
she has gone away better pleased with herself
than ever.</p>

<p>Tryphena’s attitude toward the social body
by which she is good enough to allow herself
to be surrounded is a mingling of compassion
and censure. She is <i>la justicière</i>.
She will judge with equity, even with mercy,
but she must always judge. She is perpetually
weighing, measuring, criticising,
tolerating, exercising her keen sense of the
shortcomings of man in general and woman
in particular. She will bring her standards
and set them up by your bedside. Your
scanty stock of force cannot be better used
than in contemplating and admiring them,
and you must recognize how completely she
herself attains them; you have no alternative.
If one will for ever strike human balances
one should have a broad fair page to
do it on, and Tryphena’s is already over-written
with cramped prejudices. It is a
triviality, but Tryphena’s gloves always wrinkle
at the thumbs.</p>

<p>If she had been a man she would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
been a certain kind of clergyman, and if she
had been a clergyman his legs would have
gone in gaiters. Indeed, sooner or later she
would probably have added to the name of
Tryphenus the glories of an episcopal see. She
is past mistress of the art of kindly rebuke.
But I do not wish to be kindly rebuked.
In that respect I am like the Roy-Regent,
and all other persons whom Providence has
enabled to do without this attention. She
has more principles than any one person is
entitled to, and she is always putting them
into action before you. I think it is a mistake
to imagine that people care about the
noble reasons that direct one’s doings; if one’s
doings themselves provoke interest it is exceptional
luck. I wish somebody would tell
Tryphena that principles ought to be hidden
as deep as a conviction of superiority; and
see what would happen. I am sure we were
not born to edify one another.</p>

<p>The deplorable part of it is that Tryphena
leaves one inclined to follow her in the steep
and narrow path that leads to self-esteem.
I find myself at this moment not only in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
bad temper, but in a vein of criticism which
I am inclined to visit upon persons whom I
am usually entirely occupied in admiring.
My friend the Bengal Lancer has just ridden
by, with his hand on his hip. It has never
struck me before that to ride with a hand on
the hip is a sign of irredeemable vanity. The
Gunner was here to tea yesterday—he of the
Mountain Battery—and told us stories of
his mules. I think disparagingly of his mules.
That a mule will “chum up to” a pony and
kick a donkey, seems this morning an imbecile
statement of an improbable fact, though
I admit I laughed at the time, it was so
British. The unpaid Attaché came too.
The unpaid Attaché gives one the impression
of never allowing himself to be as
charming as he might be. What foolish
fear can justify this reticence? Enthusiasm,
we all know, is permitted to the gods and to
foreigners only, but even an unpaid Attaché
can afford a whole smile.</p>

<p>The worst that can be said of Delia is
that numbers of people whom she doesn’t
care a button about call her a dear. At least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
that is the worst I can think of. As to
Thalia, I had a note from her yesterday in
which she spelled my name wrong. This after
two years of notes. It may have been an
accident; but much as I love Thalia I am
disposed—this morning—to think that there
is somewhere in her a defect obscure, elementary,
which matches this. What is the
worst they know of me? I have not the
least idea, but I am prepared—this morning—to
hope it is something rather bad.</p>

<p>The fact is that here in our remote and
arbitrary and limited conditions we are rather
like a colony in a lighthouse; we have
nothing but ourselves and each other, and
we grow overwrought, over-sensitive to the
personal impression. I suppose that is what
has produced, has at least aggravated, cases
like Tryphena’s. It is a thing to be on
one’s guard against. I quite see that if my
own symptoms increase I shall shortly arrive
at the point of being unable to endure the
sight of many persons superior to myself;
which is illogical and ridiculous.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIX</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; WAS congratulating the hydrangea
this morning on its delightful attitude
toward life. This is no virtue of the
hydrangea’s; it is a thing conferred,
a mere capacity, but how enviable! All
through its youth and proper blossoming
time, which is the rains, it has the pink-and-white
prettiness that belongs to that period.
When it is over, instead of acknowledging
middle age by any form of frumpishness
the hydrangea grows delicately green again;
it retires agreeably, indistinguishably into
leaves, a most artistic pose. That, too,
passes in these sharp days when the sun is
only gold that glitters, and the hydrangea,
taking its unerring tone from the season,
turns a kind of purplish rose, and still never
drops a petal, never turns a hair. In the end
the hydrangea will be able to say with truth
that it has not died without having lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Sooner or later I might perhaps have seen
that for myself, but it was Cousin Christina
who pointed it out to me. It is one of the
subtler and more gratifying forms of selfishness
to ask persons of taste to help you to
enjoy your garden; and at no one’s expense
do I indulge in this oftener than at Cousin
Christina’s. She spends more time with me
here under the pencil-cedar than any one else
does, partly because I think she likes me a
little and the garden a great deal, and partly
because she has fallen, recently, upon very
idle circumstances.</p>

<p>We always thought, she and I, that we
should more or less take to one another.
Mutual friends told us so, and there was
evidence to support the statement. We
approved what they carried back and forth
between us of our respective habits and
opinions; and once I saw a scrap of her
interesting handwriting conveying a view
in terms very net. Constantly we were
made to feel that upon the basis of human
intercourse—the delicate terms of which
who can quite expose?—we had things to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
give each other, and constantly we said with
intention, “Next summer I must really manage
to meet her.” That is all I knew of
Cousin Christina, except that life had offered
her, somehow, less than she had a title to,
and that she spent a great deal of time in
her garden.</p>

<p>And then—“on sait trop de cela, que
les heures sont comptées à l’homme qui doit
mourir, et on agit comme si le trésor de ces
heures était inépuisable, l’occasion indéfiniment
renouvable et nos amis éternels.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Cousin Christina died last year, and we had
never met.</p>

<p>It will be judged how much I value her
visits now, now that she has so far to come,
and her efforts to make me understand; we
who remain are so deaf. There were many
points at which the world irritated her while
she was conditioned in it; and I think the
remoteness of this place appeals to her in
her freedom; she is pleased in its great lines
and vast spaces which yet hold just the
touch of human enterprise and affection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
which she too thought essential, here in my
garden. She seems, at all events, to belong
to the vague, as if she loved it, and of course
I can never lay my hand on her.</p>

<p>She is devoted to the garden, constantly
she trails about it, having nothing to say to
me, with precisely that attitude toward a
rose and that hand under a top-heavy aster
which separates the true lover from the mere
admirer. Dahlias swing free as she passes,
and leaves that keep the sun off the convolvuluses
get out of their way. It is not the
wind, it is Cousin Christina. She is more
intimate with the flowers than I; almost
invariably, when I show her anything new
in bloom she informs me “I saw that yesterday.”
She does not seem to think it a liberty
to see another person’s flowers before
the person herself. I criticise her there.</p>

<p>I cannot put down what she says in the
form of dialogue, because, although the meaning
is plain, it seems to take some other.
She herself is amused at the idea of confining
her within quotation marks. It comes
to this that I can give you only an essence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
an extract, of what she conveys. How
blundering and explosive, after Cousin
Christina’s way, are the great words of
other people! I like sleeping in the attic
because the sun climbing up behind the
shoulder of Jakko, comes in there first.
This morning, looking up through the
little high window in the wall I saw a
hawk sailing with broad sunlight on
his wings, though none had reached the
window yet, and the attic was still grey and
waiting. I have seen it all day, the hawk
up there with his wings gleaming, but it was
Cousin Christina who suggested that perhaps
after all it was only necessary to rise
high enough to meet the light. A more
definite showing, it appears, was what she
lacked most in life. Among a bewildering
worldful of facts, appearances and incidents,
vague, she complains, is the short existence,
and untrustworthy the interests which are
our only guides to spend it to the best
account. She seems grieved now to discover
how much more there was and how
much better worth doing. Upon one thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
only I feel that she congratulates herself.
Among our poor chances there is one which
is supreme, and she had it. Within her
radius she <i>saw</i>. The mirror was hers which
prints the lovely suggestion of things, and I
have learned from her and from the garden
that there is no finer or more delicate or
more charming occupation for a person of
leisure than to sit and polish her mirror.</p>

<p>She did not live as long as I wish to do,
and I think at the time she would have
been glad to stay. Nevertheless, she looks
with no great encouragement upon the
efforts after completer health which I hope
I have not too continuously referred to in
these chapters. I gather from her that if
you are asked to an entertainment, you do
not reproach your host that it is so soon
over, nor are you supposed to resent other
people getting more extended invitations.
The lights and the music please you, but
at the end you never hesitate to step outside
again into the dark. Perhaps we are
all here quite as long as we are wanted.
Life is very hospitable, but she cannot put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
on every card “1 to 70 years.” I gather
that these are Cousin Christina’s views;
and I reply that it is easy to be wise after
the event, which I am nevertheless still
inclined to postpone.</p>

<p>On days when life is a pure pleasure she
is not much with me, but on days when it
is a mere duty—she knew many of those
herself, poor dear—I can always depend
upon her. It was she who lifted her long-handled
glasses and looked at Thisbe, who
one morning came and stood in the sun
between us, and quoted,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“A happy soul that all the way</div>
<div class="verse">To heaven hath a summer’s day,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>which exactly prints Thisbe, and she who
described Lutetia as soothing but uninteresting,
like a patent food—her invalid’s fancies
seem to cling to her. Cousin Christina is a
little difficult to please; she dismissed the
fresh-coloured, vigorous Alexandra very
shortly as a nice thing growing in a garden,
and when I hinted that Alexandra held
views of her own she admitted that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
creature had a strong scent. She permits
herself these vagaries, these liberties with
my acquaintances, the majority of whom
she finds, I fear, a trifle limited. And she
has a courage of expression which belongs, I
am sure, only to the disembodied. Nothing
rouses her to more impatience than the expression
“quite a character.” Is it not
deplorable and distressing, she demands,
that we are not all characters? She herself
was very much of a character, one could
imagine soft, stupid, little women saying so,
at meetings to dress dolls for zenanas, and
how it would irritate her when the mild
imputation was brought home to her. She
is delightful to take one’s indignations to;
she underlines every word, though she pretends
a tolerance for the unintelligent which
I am sure she does not feel. “Consider,”
I almost heard her say, “if we clever ones
of the world were not so few, how miserable
the stupid ones would be! Secure in their
grunting majority they let us smite them
and turn the other cheek, but if they had to
grunt solitarily!” She sometimes forgets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
like that, that she is gone, is not. How
sharp must have been the individuality that
refuses so obstinately to blend with the universal
current!</p>

<p>In the simple mosaic here, put together
at odd times, piece by piece rubbed up as it
came and set in its place, many of the fragments
are here. I know this because they
are not things that would naturally occur to
me, whereas they correspond exactly with
the sentiments I know she used to hold. I
have nevertheless written them out without
scruple because she seems in a way to have
given them to me.</p>

<p>My possession in her is uncertain after
all, hardly greater, I suppose, than a kind
of constructive regret. Yet somehow I
imagine it is more tangible than hers in the
asters and the carnations. Her impressions
were always strong and her affections always
loyal; but divested, denuded as she is, I
fancy it must be only the memory that
flowers are beautiful that brings her here,
poor ghost.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XX</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is sharp on these mountains now,
keen, glorious weather. In the house
Thisbe cowers over a fire from morning
to night. I call it abject; she retorts
that no English winter has ever produced in
her so much goose-flesh, and that she came
to India to be warm. Even I must bend to
acknowledge the virtues of a hot-water bottle,
and I have abandoned the pencil-cedar;
the deck chair now chases the sun. Every
hour we shift farther and farther to the
west, until at about four o’clock he dips behind
the castle of the Princess, and then we
grow very grey and melancholy on the shelf.
It is, after all, the great sun of India; if it
falls steadily upon your feet it will slowly
warm them through the shivering air; but
nothing, not even a dahlia, must come between
you and it. Even a dahlia makes a
difference. The glare upon this page is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
particularly unpleasant, but I have permanently
closed my parasol; the double sensation
of icy fingers and toasting feet was
worse. It is more than I bargained for, a
week, as a matter of fact, beyond my contract
time; and only the fear of taking cold
there keeps me from going into the house.</p>

<p>Whatever forebodings the garden feels it
puts a brave front upon the matter. It is
smart with zinnias now; in ranks they
stand, like soldiers, always at attention. I
have no patience with people who are too
æsthetic for zinnias, who complain of their
stiffness and their commonness and what
not. I think the zinnia a particularly delightful
creature, full of courage and character
and cheerful confidence, and here where
we have to make such a fight for a bit of
colour against the void it is invaluable. It
may not be exactly a lovable flower, but
what of that? Many of us must be content
to be estimable. There is even joy in a
zinnia. From where I sit I look through a
fringe of them along the paling where they
almost glitter in the sun. Beyond are a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
dark deodar tops and an oak from which the
last yellow leaves are fluttering, fluttering,
and behind the tracery of this the blue sky
bending to the still sharp snowy ranges. If
you shut your eyes and succeed in seeing
that, you may almost forget that I am in
India and you somewhere else; we are both,
really, very near Thibet and not far, I
imagine, from heaven.</p>

<p>Nor would anybody, I am sure, ever
think of India and chrysanthemums together.
Yet the shelf is glorious with
chrysanthemums, purple and bronze and
gold and white. My gardening now takes
the form of kind attentions to the chrysanthemums.
Atma will tie them up with
what I can only call swaddling strings, round
their necks or their waists or anywhere,
without the slightest regard for their comfort.
Whereas if there is one thing a
chrysanthemum pleads for, it is freedom to
exercise its own eccentric discretion with
regard to pose. There is no refreshment
to exile like the cold sharp fragrance of
chrysanthemums, especially white ones. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
brings back, straight back, the glistening
pavement of Kensington High Street on a
wet November night and the dear dense
smell of London and a sense of the delight
that can be bought for sixpence there.
Delight should be cheap but not too cheap.
I am thankful sometimes for the limitations
of our shelf and the efforts we must make to
keep it pretty, and the fact that we have to
consider whether leaf-mould is not rather
dear at fourpence a basket. It must be
difficult to keep in relation with a whole
mountain-side, which is the estate of some
people, or with six thousand rupees a month,
which is the pay of a Member of Council.
I should lease most of the mountain-side, I
think, and put the rupees in bags and lock
them up in a vault, just anyhow, as the rajahs
do. To be aware that you had a vault full
of rupees in bags would remove every care
from life, but not to be obliged to know
exactly how many bags there were would fill
it with peace and ecstasy. There is solid
comfort in a bag of rupees—I have possessed,
at times, a little one—but in a vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
income which you never see there must be
a vague dissatisfaction, as well as bank-books
and separate accounts, and cheques
and other worries which you must infallibly
remember to date. The East teaches us
much of simplicity and comfort in the persons
of its princes. It has taught me the
real magnificence of rupees in a bag.</p>

<p>Atma and I have had a morning of great
anticipations. It is time now to look forward,
time to provision the garden against
the greedy spring, and to make plans. In
all my plans the paling figures largely; it
is a hand-rail between us and eternity, naturally
things look well against it. Next year
we are going to have hollyhocks, single
and double, pink and rose and white, in a
rampart all along the paling as it follows
the sweep of the shelf, and spraying thickly
out from these the biggest and whitest marguerites
that will consent to come up, and
along the border the broad blue ribbon of
forget-me-nots. Farther on where the
shelf widens in front of the house and the
deodars rise thick before it, a creamy Devoniensis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
is already in possession of the paling,
and here my goldenrod is to stand
fretted against the firs, and dwarf sunflowers
shall fraternize with it; and about its
skirts shall grow myriads of coreopsis single
and double, and masses of puce-coloured
Michaelmas daisies, and at their feet the
grateful simple-minded purple petunia in
the largest families, as thick as ever she
likes. I did not mention it before, because
one does hate to be always complaining,
but Tiglath-Pileser has invaded the garden
with some Japanese plums; straight up they
stick in the widest part of the paling border,
and discouragingly healthy they look.
Round two of these I have planted portulaca
and ringed it with lobelia, and round
the other two lobelia, and ringed it with
little pink lilies. The roses in the bed
opposite the dining-room window have
grown rather leggy with age, and next year
they are to rise out of a thick and, as I see
it, low forest of pink and white candytuft,
and the bed is to be deeply framed in pansies.
We are to have foxgloves on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
khud rank above rank, and wallflowers on
its more accessible projections, and in the
rains the gayest crowd of dahlias of the
ballet, the single degenerates, are to gather
there. Atma is to get them where he likes
and I am to ask no questions. I am homesick
for a certain very sweet, very yellow
rather small and not very double brier rose
that belongs to other years when it was
much presented to “the teacher,” also for a
modest little fringed pink with a dark line on
its petals which made the kind of posy one
offered to one’s grandmother. But I fear
the other years are a country one cannot
rediscover in every part; though I have
asked diligently of persons who also inhabited
them I have not yet found my gentle pink
or my little yellow rose. Then a bed of irises
is to be made just over the kitchen roof, to
take the eye off it, and the garden lilies,
which are mostly madonnas, are to foregather
in one place instead of being scattered
about as they are now among the rose-bushes.
Thisbe thinks nothing could be
lovelier than a lily and a rose, but I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
agree with her. The combination savours
of <i>trop de luxe</i>, it recalls an early Victorian
lacquered tea-tray. If she likes to mix her
garden-parties like that she can, but my lilies
must express themselves with no other flower
to interfere with them. A lily has so little
to say to the world; it must have an atmosphere
of the completest reticence if it is to
speak at all. The roses will be reinforced
by twenty-five other sorts from the Government
Gardens at Saharanpore; and there
are to be several new admittances to the
home for decayed gentlewomen. The border
nearest the upper khud has been arranged to
take everything we don’t want in other places—the
phloxes, the antirrhinums, the lupins
and carnations and gaillardias and surpluses
of all sorts which it would be a sin to throw
away. It will be a kind of garden-attic, but
the medley should be bright. Also, to do
him justice, Tiglath-Pileser has given me a
wild-rose hedge round our whole property,
along both roads and up and down the
khuds. Thick and fragrant it will be in
May and starred with creamy blossoms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
He said he owed me something on account
of the grafts, and I could not conscientiously
dispute the matter. So that will be my garden,
I hope, of next year. It will hold no
brilliant effects; we only want to be gay and
merry on the shelf and to keep certain relations
intact; we have no room to be ambitious.
I know now at least where my garden
begins and where it leaves off, and a little
more. Next year I hope to pretend to that
intimate knowledge which comes of having
gone over every foot of it, without which no
one should say anything, or even write anything
probably. However, Elizabeth<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> did,
and everybody liked it. Elizabeth began
as a complete amateur; and her very amateurity
disarmed criticism. She had nothing
but taste and affection, and her struggles to
garden upon this capital have often sympathetically
occurred to me during the past
summer. Frequently I have had occasion
to say to her, speaking quite anonymously,
“What would you think of that, Elizabeth,
supposing you lived on a shelf?” and often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
in the depression of wondering whether it
was quite fair to try to follow her charming
fashion, I have explained that I really have
to write about my garden; I was turned out
in it, I had no more choice than Nebuchadnezzar;
and that I sincerely hope I have
not plagiarized her plants. And I assured
her it is a thing I would never do, that those
hereinbefore mentioned grew for me, every
one, from seed or bulb—that I would not
ever plagiarize from Mr. Johnson, whose
Japanese lilies were glorious to behold this
year and very moderate.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these meek statements I
feel, here at the end of the book and the
end of the summer, highly experienced and
knowledgeable about gardens. I long to
pour out accumulated facts, and only a
doubt of the relative value of advice produced
at an altitude of seven thousand feet
in the middle of Asia prevents my doing so.
In more serious moments I hardly dare hope
that I have not already talked too much
about my garden and other things, but nobody
should be severe upon this who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
not discovered the entertainment to be got
out of a perfectly silent visiting public. I
should confess that I have enjoyed it enormously;
it would be becoming in me to
thank that mute impersonal body for a delightful
summer. It is such an original
pleasure to go on saying exactly what you
like and briefly imagine replies, as well as
a valuable aid, I am sure, to convalescence.
To have increased the sum of the world’s
happiness by one’s own is perhaps no great
accomplishment, yet is it so easy? Neither
can it be called especially virtuous to feel a
little better, but what moral satisfaction is
there to compare with it?</p>

<p>The summer and the book are done.
The procession of the Days has gone by, all
but a straggler or two carrying a tattered
flag; it took seven months to pass a given
point. There is a rustling among the roses
when the wind comes this way, but nearly
always the blue void holds a golden silence.
Belated butterflies bask on the warm gravel
with wings expanded and closed down.
Wooing is dangerous now; shadows overtake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
you, and a shadow kills. The zinnias
are all old soldiers, the Snows have come
nearer in the night. Some morning soon
they will have crept over the shelf, but only
Atma will see that. The rest of the family
will be occupying a spot under the warm
dust haze down below, so far down as to be
practically below sea-level. The vicissitudes
of some lives!</p>
